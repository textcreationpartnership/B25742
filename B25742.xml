            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF I were to make any <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> for this <hi>Treatise</hi> in it's <hi>Original Language,</hi> it should
<pb facs="tcp:173675:8"/> be such a One as a sober <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> of my Acquaintance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly makes for his <hi>Claret: He never drank better in his Life.</hi> But <hi>good Books</hi> like <hi>good Wine,</hi> in the old <hi>Proverb,</hi> need no <hi>Recommendation.</hi> However, this of <hi>the Action of an Orator,</hi> has been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally approved of and applauded through many successful <hi>Editions</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> And I confess in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously, that this <hi>English Translation</hi> of that <hi>Tract,</hi> is wholly owing to the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Character, which the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Sir <hi>ROGER L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRANGE</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
<pb facs="tcp:173675:8"/> Dr. <hi>WAKE</hi> have been pleased to give it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preamble</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> indeed is somewhat of the <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</hi> But that's a Fault and no Fault; for whoever gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the trouble of Reading it <hi>all over,</hi> he will certainly be the <hi>better</hi> for't. In short, the <hi>Question</hi> was, whether <hi>Action</hi> or <hi>No Action</hi> ought to be used in Publick; and a <hi>Controversy</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally arising upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Phanaticism</hi> and <hi>Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> it was the <hi>longer</hi> a-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining in the <hi>Introduction</hi> to the main Work; in order to distinguish the <hi>Decency</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:173675:9"/> thing both from <hi>Extravagance</hi> and <hi>Dullness.</hi> But the <hi>Subject</hi> is wholly <hi>New,</hi> and the <hi>Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is worth any <hi>Young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Money in the Kingdom; especially if he lays under any Temptation of the <hi>Air, Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of a good <hi>PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUNCIATION</hi> and <hi>GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STURE,</hi> either for the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Court,</hi> or the <hi>Camp.</hi> The <hi>Divine,</hi> the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi> and the <hi>Soldier</hi> are the Men of the World, who have most occasion to <hi>speak well in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:</hi> And if our <hi>English Youth</hi> were train'd up more in the <hi>Art of Oratory</hi> and better instructed in the Rules of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTION,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:173675:9"/> why might they not become as <hi>Great Men</hi> and as <hi>Good Speakers,</hi> as ever <hi>GREECE</hi> or <hi>ROME</hi> yet produc'd.</p>
            <p>In fine, This <hi>Book</hi> is no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to <hi>Good Breeding,</hi> and it intrenches upon no Mans <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation</hi> or <hi>Profession.</hi> The <hi>Dancing-School</hi> indeed teaches <hi>Gesture</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> wonderfully well, and the <hi>Ballance of the Body</hi> to Perfection; but it can never do the whole Business of an <hi>ORATOR</hi> nor accomplish him with all necessary <hi>ACTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON</hi> either for the <hi>Pulpit</hi> or the <hi>Barr,</hi> till the <hi>Feet</hi> can speak
<pb facs="tcp:173675:10"/>
               <hi>Figures</hi> and the <hi>Hands</hi> plead <hi>Causes.</hi> 'Tis certain however, that <hi>Eloquence</hi> does not lay in the <hi>Heels,</hi> nor <hi>RHETO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICK</hi> in <hi>Frisking</hi> and <hi>Gesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I have <hi>Translated</hi> this <hi>Book</hi> as well as I could, and perhaps the <hi>FRENCH</hi> has lost nothing by't.

               <hi>First</hi> then, the thing is <hi>New, Learned</hi> and <hi>Ingenious</hi> in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. It treats of <hi>Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> in particular; which are the very Life and Soul of <hi>Rhetorick.</hi> It is founded upon the best <hi>Authorities</hi> of the Ancients, Ecclesiastical, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Civil; and yet plausibly adapted to <hi>Modern Practice</hi> and the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>present Age.</hi> It is adorned with the finest <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> and <hi>Beauties</hi> of <hi>Elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and illustrated with the most <hi>Glorious Examples.</hi> Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I might by an easy <hi>Metaphor</hi> call it an <hi>Universal Constellation of Eloquence.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:173675:11"/> But as for <hi>GESTURE,</hi> there never was any thing done like it <hi>before;</hi> the <hi>Rules</hi> are so very <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>New,</hi> even to a <hi>first Discovery.</hi> A Genteel regular <hi>Movement of the Body,</hi> without doubt, goes a great way in the Character of a <hi>Publick Orator;</hi> for there is nothing so taking or so much admir'd now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days as that which is <hi>ACTED</hi> to the Life; strikes the <hi>Senses</hi> and captivates the <hi>Mind.</hi> So that <hi>GESTURE,</hi> in fine, is not improperly called the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of the Body</hi> and the last <hi>Accomplishment</hi> of <hi>Speech.</hi>

               <hi>In the next Place:</hi> Besides the <hi>Intrinsick Worth</hi> of this <hi>Treatise,</hi> I may with good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son also recommend the <hi>usefulness</hi> of it to the <hi>Grammar-Schools,</hi> the <hi>Universities</hi> and the <hi>Inns of Court;</hi> And I hope I shall not be charged either with <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> or <hi>Praesumption</hi> for my Pains, after a <hi>fair Perusal.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I shall take upon me to say, that it will make as excellent a <hi>School-Book</hi> for <hi>BOYES</hi> as any extant; to reform the <hi>viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habits</hi> of their <hi>PRONUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIATION;</hi> to refine the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Rudeness of their <hi>BEHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR;</hi> to polish the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb facs="tcp:173675:12"/> Clownishness</hi> of their <hi>GESTURE,</hi> and to give them a true <hi>Light</hi> at last into the main end and design of <hi>RHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORICK,</hi> which is to express themselves <hi>distinctly</hi> and <hi>handsomely</hi> in their <hi>Exercices</hi> upon all Occasions.

            <head>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THis Treatise, short</hi> as it is, will be thought too <hi>long</hi> I fear for several Reasons: But the two <hi>main Objections</hi> will be these. <hi>Some</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:173675:14"/> perhaps will say that I am <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large</hi> and more <hi>nice</hi> then I need be upon the <hi>variation of the Voyce:</hi> And <hi>others</hi> may think that my <hi>Rules of Rhetorick</hi> are over-stockt with <hi>Examples</hi> and needed not all that Train of Illustration. But in <hi>Answer</hi> to both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I shall shew 'em that there's neither a <hi>Praecept</hi> nor an <hi>Example</hi> too <hi>many,</hi> and that they ought not to fall out with either of them for swelling this <hi>little Book</hi> up to such a <hi>size.</hi> This I will do in as few Words as the Matter will bear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As to <hi>those</hi> on the one hand, that think I am too <hi>long</hi> and <hi>exact</hi> upon the Business of <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> and have said <hi>too much</hi> of the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of the Voice;</hi> They cannot in Justice blame me for being so <hi>particular</hi> upon the two <hi>main Points</hi> of <hi>Oratory.</hi> For the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>speaking
<pb facs="tcp:173675:14"/> well</hi> and of <hi>varying the Voice;</hi> the necessity of the one and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the <hi>other,</hi> will abundantly answer for the <hi>length</hi> of <hi>this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:</hi> And pray let 'em consider over and above, that though <hi>some People</hi> may meet with several things here not worth <hi>their while;</hi> there are <hi>many others</hi> yet, both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> will be the <hi>better</hi> for them, and find them written to <hi>some purpose.</hi> Most Men that speak in <hi>Publick</hi> now-a-days, whether in <hi>Churches</hi> or in <hi>Courts,</hi> are so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally addicted to a kind of <hi>MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOTONY;</hi> a fulsome way of <hi>accenting every Word they speak, with the same Tone:</hi> They find so much difficulty also to correct the <hi>Vice,</hi> and are so puzzled often how to <hi>vary the Voice,</hi> as they should do, with a true Government of the Tongue, that it was but <hi>necessary</hi> to give them so <hi>many Hints</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:173675:15"/>
               <hi>Precautions</hi> against a vicious way of <hi>speaking,</hi> that is not only disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to <hi>themselves,</hi> but trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to <hi>others</hi> and disagreeable to <hi>all Mankind.</hi> And why should not I then arm them at all points to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome so strong an Infirmity, as an imperfection of the Mind, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with Inclination? Or, why should not I prescribe to them all the <hi>Remedies</hi> I could think of for the cure of so great an <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for <hi>those,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, that find fault with me for stuffing my Discourse with too <hi>many Examples,</hi> and for gathering up such a <hi>Cloud of Testimonies</hi> to make good the <hi>Rules</hi> here propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I have <hi>this</hi> to say for't. <hi>First,</hi> That these Authorities, quoted out of the best <hi>Writers</hi> and <hi>Orators,</hi> so famous all over the World for their Learning and Eloquence, do add
<pb facs="tcp:173675:15"/> a certain Beauty and Lustre to the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>this Art.</hi> Besides, they give my <hi>Praecepts</hi> a Reputation and Credit as well as an agreeable <hi>Light, Air</hi> and <hi>Grace:</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, if I had expos'd them <hi>Nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to the World, as they lay, and not dressed them up in <hi>these Robes</hi> of <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Testimony,</hi> they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared indecent as well as mean and ordinary. And this is so noble a <hi>dress</hi> too, that if becomes the <hi>present Age;</hi> suits the Orator very well here at <hi>Home,</hi> and sets-off the Subject I am upon, though the <hi>Fashion</hi> be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so <hi>old,</hi> or never so <hi>far-fetcht</hi> from <hi>abroad.</hi> But, <hi>secondly,</hi> I have <hi>this</hi> also to urge further, that <hi>these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> do not only adorn my <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> which are not so very pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps or agreeable <hi>of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi> but illustrate them too, and make them more easy and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And they are likewise the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb facs="tcp:173675:16"/> helps in Nature, towards the putting of <hi>Praecepts</hi> in Practice with a Fecility of Application, as well as for making use of them to the best Advantage upon all occasions. For there's no doubt but an <hi>Example</hi> read upon the Heels of a <hi>Praecept,</hi> enlightens the Mind, quickens the Understanding, and makes the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our own</hi> for ever to all intents and purposes.</p>
            <p>This was the Reason I had to write of <hi>ACTION</hi> here in so ample a manner as I have done, to shew it in its <hi>just Proportion</hi> and at <hi>full length:</hi> And besides, as for the <hi>Method</hi> I have taken, be it as it will, some of my <hi>best Friends</hi> put me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on't, advised it and encouraged it into the World; for had it not been in <hi>Complement</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever so much as <hi>written this little Tract,</hi> and much less yet would I ever have
<pb facs="tcp:173675:16"/> made it Publick in <hi>Print.</hi> The Truth on't is: As I was equally convinc'd of the Light of their Understanding, the solidity of their Judgment and the syncerity of their Affection; so I thought my self obliged in good manners to take every thing for granted they said concerning the <hi>disposition</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of <hi>this Work:</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially considering that I undertook it purely for <hi>their Satisfaction,</hi> and out of an Ambition I had to gratify my <hi>Friends</hi> above <hi>all Men living.</hi> However, if any thing be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss in it, after all, <hi>they</hi> must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for't, and let the success on't be what it will, I shall be in no great pain for my <hi>own security</hi> and <hi>defence</hi> under <hi>their Protection.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THere's no manner of doubt but <hi>Judicious Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Sound Reasoning</hi> do the Work of an <hi>Orator,</hi> and certainly convince the <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> more than
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173675:20"/> any Thing in the World; It must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be granted that the <hi>digesting</hi> of the one and the other into <hi>Order,</hi> does at once give us a distinct knowledge of Things, and a Facility of retaining them; and none can deny at last how much a curious <hi>Choice</hi> of fine Words, and the <hi>Art of placing</hi> them in a Discourse, do set-off <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Thought</hi> with Grace, Lustre and Power to Admiration: So that the <hi>Great Masters</hi> of <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> have set up <hi>Invention, Disposition,</hi> and <hi>Elocution</hi> for the <hi>three first parts</hi> of <hi>Oratory.</hi> But finding afterwards that the <hi>Sensitive Appetite</hi> and its <hi>Affections</hi> had a wonderful Ascendant over the <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> as well as the <hi>Will;</hi> and our <hi>Passions</hi> again being most wrought upon by present <hi>Objects</hi> and what strikes in at our <hi>Senses,</hi> they found themselves under a necessity of adding a <hi>Fourth Part:</hi> That is, <hi>ACTION;</hi> which consists of <hi>Speaking</hi> and <hi>Gesture. Action,</hi> which was look'd upon by the <hi>Antient Orators,</hi> to be so important a Qualification, that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> has made no difficulty of reckoning upon't for the <hi>First, Second</hi> and <hi>Third</hi> Faculty of Eloquence, all in <hi>one:</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173675:20"/> of the same opinion too, when he said that it had the <hi>Sole Power</hi> and <hi>Sovereign Command</hi> in a <hi>Speech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, if a Man's Business were only to make a <hi>fine Sermon,</hi> or to draw an <hi>Elegant Plea,</hi> the three first parts of <hi>Oratory</hi> would accomplish him with all necessary Perfections for the work: But when he should come then to the Point of <hi>Speaking,</hi> and of moving the minds of his Hearers to the Life, they would all seem dispassionate and <hi>Dead</hi> to the Discourse, without <hi>Action</hi> to quicken-up their attention, and to make the matter infinitely <hi>taking.</hi> For it has often been the Fortune of an <hi>Orator</hi> excellently well qualifi'd with the most Essential Parts of Eloquence, to be heard on a <hi>Publick Occasion,</hi> with Impatience and Contempt, upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry account of a <hi>Bad Pronunciation</hi> and <hi>Awkward Gestures:</hi> When not half so Great a Master of Language, that had the Genteelness of <hi>Action</hi> with it, has come-off both with the Delight and the Applause of his <hi>Audience.</hi> So Powerfull an Influence has this Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the <hi>Senses;</hi> That the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and <hi>Farewell</hi> it leaves upon us, is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173675:21"/> the <hi>Orator</hi>'s Fate. As for instance, <hi>Philostratus</hi> tells us of <hi>one Philiscus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Eloquent Barristers,</hi> whose <hi>Lives</hi> he has Written, that he spake <hi>Greek</hi> to Purity and Perfection; that he made it better than it came off the <hi>Lip,</hi> and that he had an incomparable <hi>Voyce</hi> too: but so ungainly a way of <hi>Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> into the bargain, that the <hi>Emperor Antoninus</hi> (whose very nature it was to countenance Men of the <hi>Long Robe</hi>) bad him hold his Tongue once, and would not grant him the <hi>Point</hi> he <hi>Pleaded</hi> for, which several others had gained upon his <hi>Majesty</hi> before. <hi>Quintilian,</hi> on the other hand, reports it; that <hi>Trachallus</hi> was none of the best <hi>Orators</hi> of his Time, and yet out did all the Men of that Profession in his <hi>Pleading:</hi> He made so plausible an appearance, what with the stateliness of his <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Port,</hi> the sparkling of his <hi>Eyes,</hi> the Majesty of his <hi>Looks,</hi> and the Beauty of his <hi>Mien;</hi> besides a <hi>Voyce,</hi> that did not only come-up to a <hi>Tragaedian</hi>'s for Gravity and Compos'dness, but went far beyond any <hi>Actor</hi>'s too that ever yet spake upon the Stage. So for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173675:21"/> I have heard an <hi>Harangue</hi> made some time since to a <hi>Nobleman of France;</hi> that, to my thinking, was an excellent Discourse, as well for the depth of Argument as for the fineness and strength of Eloquence; and it had certainly got that Credit too upon any unprejudiced person's <hi>reading</hi> of it: But for all this, it was so indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver'd by a <hi>Gentleman</hi> that had a <hi>natural Impediment</hi> in his <hi>Speech,</hi> and one too that had no more <hi>Gesture</hi> than a <hi>Post;</hi> or if he had any, 'twas so untoward and ungenteel, that not a Man of the Company but disrelished the Eentertainment, and thought his Time lost in giving it the <hi>Hearing.</hi> I have known likewise, on the contrary, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an <hi>indifferent Orator,</hi> both in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and at the <hi>Barr,</hi> that have set themselves off with extraordinary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and have been cry'd up for <hi>Good Preachers</hi> and <hi>Great Lawyers,</hi> upon the bare credit of their fine way of <hi>Speaking</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> In short, these <hi>External Graces</hi> of <hi>Speech</hi> work such <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>'s and <hi>Biasses</hi> upon the <hi>Auditors,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the performance of them, better or worse; that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:173675:22"/> which was the most moving part of his <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> and there's nothing at all of His extant but some <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Publick Acts,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports. For, as to <hi>those Speeches</hi> which we read in <hi>Thucidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> for His, they were made by the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> himself, and the <hi>Orator</hi> had no hand in them. <hi>Hortensius,</hi> on the other hand, seeing himself mightily admir'd for his <hi>Pleading,</hi> ascrib'd all the honour of it to the potency of his Arguments, the Elegancy of his Reason, the Delicacy of his Stile, and other such like Graces; which after all, and in Truth, was only owing to his <hi>Pathetical Action:</hi> And so he put forth his <hi>Orations</hi> upon that mistake, but was not half so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with his <hi>Pen</hi> as he had been with his <hi>Tongue;</hi> and <hi>Hortensius</hi> was now reputed a better <hi>Lawyer</hi> than an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</hi> For, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> says, his <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Speeches</hi> were much inferior to his mighty Character at the <hi>Barr;</hi> and it was as clear as the Sun, that he had spoken a great many entertaining things off in <hi>Court</hi> with <hi>Grace</hi> and good <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which were never to be met with again upon the <hi>Reading</hi> of them.

               <p>This is <hi>that</hi> Faculty of <hi>Oratory,</hi> which <hi>Tully</hi> calls the <hi>Eloquence of the Body:</hi> and it is a matter of so great Moment for the prevalent Influences and effects it has upon the Mind, that 'twere to be wished the <hi>Antients</hi> had treated of <hi>Action</hi> with as much exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of method, and in as ample a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

               <p>Wherefore many ingenious Men have wish'd a long time that some Body would write such a <hi>Treatise</hi> as this; seeing that most of our <hi>Publick Orators,</hi> both in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and at the <hi>Barr,</hi> do often blunder very grosly against the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Good Speaking,</hi> for want of it: And no person appearing all the while that would take it in hand, several of my Friends and Acquaintance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented me with the Honour and the necessity of the Subject, and gave me a thousand importunities to set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the work; which I all along de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined yet, for reasons best known to my self and my own Incapacity.

               <p>I know there are several People will condemn the design of <hi>this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi> at first sight, and tell you that this care of <hi>Speaking</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> is neither the business of <hi>Religion</hi> nor <hi>Law;</hi> and that it neither becomes a Person <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Divinity in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> nor a Man <hi>pleading</hi> for Justice at the <hi>Barr.</hi> Some will do this out of a <hi>phantastical Humour,</hi> like <hi>Cotta;</hi> who, as <hi>Tully</hi> says, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected old Obsolete Words, but a Clownish way of <hi>speaking</hi> too, out of a vanity to be thought an admirer of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> Others will do't, upon a Principle of <hi>Laziness;</hi> for they'll not take so much pains for a laudable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of speaking, <hi>not they:</hi> It will cost 'em more labour than the thing is worth to make themselves Masters of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173675:25"/>
                  <hi>Action,</hi> and they had rather displease all the World than be at the trouble of acquiring it. Such as <hi>they</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> condemn'd the use of Eloquence in <hi>Preaching;</hi> till St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> confuted them, and vindicated it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Aspersion and Calumny, in his <hi>Books of the Priest-hood.</hi> There are some <hi>precise people</hi> again, will decry it out of a <hi>Phanatical Superstition</hi> and <hi>Melancholy;</hi> because it is neither for their Palate nor Purity, <hi>forsooth;</hi> and <hi>they</hi> like nothing that pleases <hi>Sense,</hi> be it never so useful and profitable to the <hi>Soul:</hi> So that whatever strikes the Humour of the <hi>Age,</hi> must needs disgust <hi>Them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if I had only to do with <hi>those whimsical people,</hi> I should not be much concern'd for the <hi>Zeal</hi> or <hi>Spleen</hi> of their Opinions, nor trouble my self with their Affectation, Idleness or ill Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: But finding others yet, and those also <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>good Sense,</hi> though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a little too Rigid and Severe, that make it a <hi>Case of Conscience</hi> and think themselves in the right too; it is but reasonable, I should enquire into the meaning of so nice a Point and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173675:26"/> to satisfie their <hi>Tenderness;</hi> so that I will make it my business here to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them as far as I can, both as to the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Scruple</hi> and the <hi>truth</hi> of the matter.</p>
               <p>They say in the <hi>first place,</hi> with a regard to <hi>Preachers;</hi> that <hi>Action</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of their <hi>Ministry,</hi> and that it is a scandalous thing for those <hi>God</hi> hath honoured with so serious and sublime a Function, to be studying in the very Exercise of it, how to <hi>frame their Voyce</hi> and <hi>move their Body,</hi> when they should think of nothing but his Glory; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Majesty of his Mysteries, the Holiness of his Praecepts, the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his <hi>Church</hi> and the Salvation of his <hi>Elect.</hi> For to pretend <hi>(say they)</hi> to make people believe the Truth, and to win Souls to Faith, Piety and all Christian Virtues, not only by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of their Stile, but also by the <hi>Grace of Speaking</hi> and <hi>Power of Gesture,</hi> is to sink <hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>Sense,</hi> and to make that which is <hi>Spiritual</hi> depend upon <hi>Carnal Worship, Humane Invention</hi> and <hi>External Flourish.</hi> At this rate, they urge, <hi>Religion</hi> would be a <hi>cunning Trade</hi> indeed; and a <hi>Handy-Craft</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173675:26"/> to be driven-on by the mercenary <hi>Actors of Comedy</hi> and <hi>Tragedy</hi> in Play-Houses, who have the best <hi>knack</hi> of pleasing the people with all the little Fopperies of <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Speech;</hi> than to be profess'd by the <hi>Ministers of the Word of God.</hi> They add, in the next place, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> never study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor practis'd <hi>this Art of Action,</hi> and that it was not by this means they made so many Converts, brought over so many people to the <hi>Church</hi> and gain'd so many Souls to <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Objection</hi> I am to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here, and my <hi>Answer</hi> will be this: <hi>First,</hi> that it is not my Design to teach <hi>Old Men</hi> the <hi>Art of Speaking,</hi> who have exercis'd it for several years in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employments and Business; for <hi>they</hi> have already taken up the <hi>Way</hi> they lik'd best, whether it be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad:</hi> If <hi>Good,</hi> they have no need of <hi>Rules</hi> for't; and if <hi>Bad,</hi> it would be too hard a matter for 'em at <hi>their age</hi> ever to acquire a Better. However, some of <hi>them</hi> perhaps, upon the reading of <hi>this Book,</hi> will easily find out their own faylings by't, among the many vices of <hi>Speaking</hi> that are so disagreeable to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173675:27"/>
                  <hi>Hearer,</hi> as well as prejudicial to the <hi>Speaker,</hi> and may correct them with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no difficulty. But I propose on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to instruct <hi>Youth</hi> and assist those that are bred up to <hi>Divinity</hi> or the <hi>Law;</hi> for <hi>young Gentlemen,</hi> who have not yet got an <hi>ill habit</hi> of <hi>Speaking,</hi> are most capable of learning a <hi>Good one.</hi> And I do ingenuously cite <hi>St. Augustin</hi>'s Declaration here, which he makes in his Fourth Book of <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> for the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Oratory</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> on the behalf of my Discourse upon the <hi>Rules of Action: I do not think so well of these things</hi> (says he) <hi>as to advise Men grown up to maturity, or</hi> Men in years <hi>ever to trouble their Heads about them. It is enough for</hi> young people <hi>to make this Study their Care: And it is not fit for</hi> all those <hi>neither, that we would have well train'd up in Sacred Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Service of the Church; but only for</hi> such <hi>of them as labour under no Infirmities of</hi> Old Age, <hi>to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to so necessary an</hi> Art.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to the <hi>Case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> they alledge, and their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon't: I confess it would be a reasonable <hi>Scruple,</hi> if Christian <hi>Preachres</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:173675:27"/> made this Grace of <hi>Action</hi> their whole Study, and minded nothing else in the <hi>Application:</hi> If they spent more time in studying <hi>these external things</hi> of Ornament than in making of <hi>Sermons</hi> upon matters of such eternal moment as the Glory of <hi>GOD</hi> and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Men;</hi> if they took more Pains to <hi>set themselves off,</hi> then to <hi>edifie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> with their fine Graces; if they ascrib'd the Conviction of Truth and the Conversion of Souls to <hi>them</hi> only; and if they had no other end in composing their <hi>Voyce</hi> and their <hi>Body,</hi> but their own praise and the people's pleasure. For, if this were all their Pretension and Practice, it is certain they would most notoriously offend <hi>God;</hi> most unworthily prophane the Holiness of their <hi>Ministry;</hi> most sacrilegiously attribute that Honour to <hi>themselves,</hi> which is only due to the <hi>Grace of God</hi> and the <hi>Power of his Holy Spirit;</hi> and turn the <hi>Pulpit</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> into a <hi>Theatre</hi> of their own <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Vanity.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> forbid I should think of teaching up any such Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery to those that aspire to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Function, and ought to know
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173675:28"/> better things! My design is only to shew them how to <hi>Speak</hi> with such a Grace; that, instead of giving their <hi>Hearers</hi> an aversion by a <hi>bad Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> and a <hi>Disagreeable Gesture,</hi> they may edifie them, not only with their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and Style, but in some measure also by the decency of their <hi>Speaking</hi> and the Fineness of their <hi>Action.</hi> And I shall give 'em <hi>Rules</hi> here for order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the one and the other so <hi>Handsomely,</hi> and with such a regard to <hi>Good Manners,</hi> that nothing may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in it against <hi>Religion;</hi> nothing that does not become the Dignity of <hi>Preaching,</hi> the Majesty of the <hi>Subject</hi> they are to handle, and the Holiness of the <hi>place</hi> where they speak; nothing that does not breath of Piety, of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and of Zeal; nothing that is not fit to move in people all kinds of Godly Thoughts and Religious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and to carry them on to Repentance, Charity and Good Works. And where's the harm of all this now? Why, <hi>say they,</hi> he that studies in his <hi>Sermon</hi> how to render his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> agreeable to the <hi>Congregation,</hi> must needs take more
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:173675:28"/> pains to <hi>please</hi> than to <hi>profit,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse himself how to tickle their <hi>Ears</hi> instead of thinking seriously how to instruct their <hi>Minds</hi> and edifie their <hi>Consciences.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, this is to please their <hi>Senses:</hi> But then that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as it tends to the Glory of <hi>God</hi> and the Conversion of their <hi>Souls;</hi> as it delights their attention to the good things they are <hi>told</hi> and helps their memories to retain what they <hi>hear;</hi> it is without doubt very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and very Holy and Reverent as well as profitable and pleasing. So that if <hi>Action</hi> be suspended from <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Devotion</hi> for pleasing the <hi>Senses,</hi> they may as well forbid the <hi>use of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> because it strikes the Passions of the Soul and sets them at work upon Heaven: And yet the <hi>Old Testament</hi> makes a laudable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, for <hi>singing the sweet songs of Israel, and the admirable soft airs of Sion;</hi> which their very enemies, the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> would have been glad to have heard from the mouths of the <hi>Israelites</hi> under the affliction of their <hi>Captivity: For they that led them away Captive, required of them then a Song
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:173675:29"/> and Melody in their heaviness. Sing us one of the Songs of Sion.</hi> But then, the <hi>New Testament</hi> also sanctifies the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Musick</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and makes it a most Sacred and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Duty, to <hi>celebrate the Honour and keep up the Praises of</hi> GOD <hi>in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Faithfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They <hi>Object</hi> further yet. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles (say they)</hi> never observ'd any of these <hi>niceties.</hi> But who told <hi>them,</hi> I pray, how those Holy Men <hi>spake,</hi> or what kind of <hi>Gesture</hi> they made use of in <hi>Preaching?</hi> It is certain that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> called St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>John BOANERGES;</hi> That is to say, <hi>the Sons of Thunder:</hi> And it is as easie to infer from the <hi>Title;</hi> that, when they came to <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Gospel;</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort People to <hi>Piety;</hi> to declame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Error, Heresie</hi> and <hi>Superstition;</hi> against <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and against <hi>Vice;</hi> they were not to do't with a <hi>Faint</hi> and a <hi>Low Voyce,</hi> but with all the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence, Terror</hi> and <hi>Warmth</hi> answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Quality of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and the Greatness of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wept his <hi>Exhortations</hi> with so many Tears, as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:173675:29"/> we find in the Book of the <hi>Acts of the Holy Apostles,</hi> it is not to be imagin'd that he spake them <hi>Coldly,</hi> with a <hi>faint Gesture,</hi> or a <hi>languishing Voyce.</hi> I grant indeed that the <hi>Holy Apostles</hi> never made <hi>this Art of Action</hi> their study; but then, <hi>they</hi> as little studied either <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> or <hi>Logick,</hi> or any other of the Parts of <hi>Rhetorick:</hi> And must <hi>we</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prohibit the use of <hi>those Arts</hi> that are necessary <hi>Keyes</hi> to all other <hi>Learning,</hi> because <hi>they</hi> did not pore upon them? <hi>They</hi> kept to no certain method in their <hi>Sermons,</hi> neither were they ty'd up to the Rules the <hi>Doctors</hi> had laid down; and must <hi>we</hi> therefore fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with the way of <hi>Preaching</hi> that is practic'd at this day both with good order and decency? <hi>They</hi> were never brought-up in the <hi>Academies,</hi> nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Discipline of the <hi>Schools</hi> and of <hi>Tutors;</hi> and must <hi>we</hi> condemn the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Ʋniversities,</hi> and the Learning of <hi>Doctors,</hi> at <hi>present,</hi> because <hi>they</hi> had no occasion for't? <hi>They</hi> neither wrote nor study'd their <hi>Sermons,</hi> but spake as the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> inspir'd them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Book;</hi> and must <hi>we</hi> find fault with <hi>Divines</hi> now-a days for <hi>premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:173675:30"/> for <hi>writing</hi> or for <hi>Reading THEIRS? They</hi> minded none of these things and made use of no such helps, because they had no need of 'em at all. <hi>They</hi> had no need of <hi>Arts,</hi> nor <hi>Method,</hi> nor <hi>Academies,</hi> nor <hi>Doctors,</hi> nor <hi>Study;</hi> for the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> they receiv'd in their <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the immediate <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration</hi> of Heaven did abundantly bless them <hi>ex tempore,</hi> as often as they <hi>preached,</hi> with all kinds of <hi>Virtues</hi> far above the Pitch of Humane Invention; far above the Powers of <hi>Art,</hi> the graces of <hi>method,</hi> the Faculties of the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,</hi> the subtilties of the <hi>Doctor</hi> and the reach of <hi>Study.</hi> And then <hi>they</hi> had the guift of <hi>Miracles</hi> too, which they no sooner wrought at any time, but the truth of their <hi>preaching</hi> was demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, and people lay under the strongest convictions of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> It was but working a <hi>Miracle,</hi> and their <hi>Mission</hi> was as plain as the Sun.

               <p>However, <hi>they</hi> that have a <hi>Phanatical Qualm</hi> against the <hi>Art of Action</hi> and make a scruple on't, urge yet, that we ought to leave <hi>this knack</hi> to <hi>Stage-Players;</hi> who propose no other end to themselves of <hi>acting Comedy</hi> and <hi>Tragedy</hi> but to <hi>please</hi> people and <hi>indulge</hi> a fond inclination.

               <p>So much for the Point against <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and the business of <hi>Divines.</hi> As to the <hi>Lawyers</hi> in the next place, this is the reason of their <hi>Scruple:</hi> That <hi>God</hi> hath not appointed Men to the <hi>Publick Ministry</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> for this purpose; that they are not <hi>called to the Barr</hi> to charm the <hi>Judges</hi> with <hi>sounds,</hi> and dazzle them with <hi>appearances.</hi> They are not to endeavour to deceive them with <hi>fine words,</hi> nor to corrupt their Judgments with <hi>fair Speeches;</hi> but to tell them the <hi>naked truth</hi> of things, to shew 'em the bare <hi>matter of Fact</hi> they are to <hi>Try,</hi> in the plainest Character and Stile, and to <hi>plead</hi> the Justice of a <hi>Cause</hi> opened in <hi>Court</hi> from solid Reasons and clear Lights, from the <hi>Laws Established,</hi> and

The <hi>best Cause</hi> in the world may soon be lost for want of <hi>Action.</hi> This was the very <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Rutilius,</hi> which <hi>Cicero</hi> reports in his first Dialogue of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</hi> The <hi>Council</hi> for the <hi>Prisoner</hi> were <hi>Ru ilius</hi> himself, <hi>Cotta</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and <hi>Mucius:</hi> but they pleaded it so simply, says <hi>Tully,</hi> without any Ornament or Spirit at all; as if it had been upon a <hi>Tryal</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>imaginary Commonwealth.</hi> Not a <hi>Sigh</hi> nor an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi> among them; no <hi>Moan</hi> made, no <hi>Complaint,</hi> no <hi>Lamentation;</hi> no <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> nor <hi>Address</hi> to the <hi>People:</hi> and not one of them so much

His behaviour was fatal. He play'd the <hi>Stoick</hi> too much upon this occasion, and would neither use the means he might lawfully do for his <hi>Liberty,</hi> nor make his Defence with that Heat and Vigour which his <hi>Cause</hi> deserved: So that he was Condemn'd and Banish'd; and at once depriv'd the <hi>Commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:173675:34"/> rather into a <hi>Country</hi> where he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and esteemed, than to live any longer at <hi>Rome,</hi> either at the discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or under the discountenance of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and engage himself in the Broyles and Disturbances of Government.</p>
               <p>Besides this, <hi>Fine Action</hi> and <hi>Good Speaking</hi> do not only conduce very much to make the <hi>Judges</hi> more attentive and cautious, but to convince them also that the <hi>Orator</hi> is in Good Earnest, Syncere and Ingenuous: For, as <hi>Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficius</hi> says, they are the greatest signs of his Veracity, and that he speaks from the Bottom of his Heart; while <hi>they</hi> that want either one or t'other, seem not to believe <hi>themselves</hi> what they would have the <hi>Judges</hi> believe; because they shew no manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern nor impatience for't. This made <hi>Cicero</hi> say to an <hi>Orator</hi> of his Time that had manag'd his <hi>Client</hi>'s <hi>Cause</hi> but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coldly. <hi>If what you said there was not false, would you have pleaded on that fashion? Where was your Grief and your Grievance, your Fury and your Fire? You shew'd us no</hi> Passion <hi>of the Mind, no</hi> Action <hi>of the Body. And you were so far from enflaming our Spirits or awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:173675:34"/> our Judgements, that we had much a do to hold from sleeping in Court.</hi> When therefore a <hi>Lawyer</hi> makes it his business to <hi>speak</hi> to his Judges with an agreeable <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Tone,</hi> it is not to <hi>coax</hi> or corrupt them; it is not to court or <hi>cajole</hi> them with his <hi>fine Mien,</hi> nor to inveigle them with his <hi>fair Tongue:</hi> But, on the contrary, his <hi>plausible Pronunciation</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> is only to oblige them to do <hi>him Justice,</hi> and to discharge their <hi>own duty:</hi> 'Tis to keep up their <hi>Senses</hi> from falling a slumber, and their <hi>Minds</hi> from wand'ring; 'Tis to induce them to take the whole matter into their serious consideration, with the utmost attention of their <hi>Ears</hi> to the Truth and Right of what is so fairly made out to their <hi>Eyes;</hi> 'Tis to prepare them for judging according to <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> It is, in fine, if there were no other reason for't, to <hi>speak</hi> things as <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> would have them <hi>spoken;</hi> and every body knows that a <hi>natural way of speaking</hi> is <hi>best.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, I must urge one <hi>Argument</hi> more for it, which seems to be very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in it self, and as well worth my
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173675:35"/> while to take notice of: And that is <hi>this,</hi> if honest Men should deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>these Arts</hi> of persuasion in a <hi>Good Case,</hi> others yet would make use of them in a <hi>Bad One:</hi> whereas there's all the reason in the world they should be equally match'd, and dispute it out upon fair terms. The <hi>good</hi> at least ought to be as well arm'd as the <hi>bad.</hi> I may say as much of <hi>Action</hi> also for <hi>Divines,</hi> and apply <hi>that</hi> in particular to it which St. <hi>Austin</hi> says in general concerning all Eloquence, in his Fourth Book of <hi>Christian Doctrine. Seeing that it is the business of</hi> Rhetorick <hi>to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade</hi> things true <hi>and</hi> false <hi>indifferently, who is it dares say that</hi> Truth <hi>ought not to be guarded against</hi> Falsehood, <hi>or that a person defending it ought not to be in arms against a</hi> Fiction <hi>or a</hi> Lye? <hi>As if</hi> they <hi>that endeavour to persuade an</hi> untruth <hi>should know how to obtain the good will and attention of their</hi> hearers <hi>by a fine preamble, or a fair</hi> Exordium, <hi>and other people should know nothing at all of the</hi> Art <hi>on't: As if</hi> some <hi>might set forth a</hi> Falsehood <hi>with queintness and colour to a probability; and others should assert a</hi> Truth <hi>with so little ceremony, that the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173675:35"/> very dull recital of it, at</hi> length, <hi>would make it difficult to be understood, and hard to be believed, if not incredible: As if</hi> those, <hi>on the one hand, might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter Truth with polish and specious pretensions, and establish their Falsity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bargain with plausible arguments; and</hi> these, <hi>on the other, might neither</hi> defend <hi>what is</hi> true <hi>nor</hi> confute <hi>what is</hi> false <hi>with the Graces of Language: As if those again, should have such an influence over the minds of their</hi> Hearers <hi>whom they go about to seduce with fair speeches, as to make them conceive things with Apprehension or Astonishment, with Sadness or with Joy, to raise the Passions and to turn them to what point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they please; and</hi> these, <hi>that engage for Truth, should make use neither of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice nor Ornament, but stand like</hi> Stocks, <hi>dull, unconcern'd and impotent, without all manner of</hi> Action <hi>and</hi> Vigor. <hi>Who can be such a</hi> Blockhead <hi>as to entertain so extravagant a thought? Since Eloquence therefore has a mighty power to persuade</hi> things False <hi>as well as</hi> True, <hi>and is left to the discretion of those that have a mind to make use on't; why should not</hi> Good Men <hi>study it to maintain the Cause of</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:173675:36"/> Truth, <hi>when</hi> Ill Men <hi>put it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to defend.</hi> Injustice, <hi>to support</hi> Error, <hi>and to compass their own</hi> Wicked Ends?</p>
               <p>In fine, there are others yet that despise <hi>this Art,</hi> and reckon upon't for <hi>superfluous:</hi> For, <hi>say they, Nature</hi> has taught a Man to do well enough both as to his <hi>Pronunciation</hi> and <hi>Gesture;</hi> both how to express and how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself. But they might e'en as good say, that since <hi>God</hi> has given the Earth power to produce <hi>Bread</hi> for the food of Man, and <hi>Wine</hi> to make his Heart Glad; therefore it will do't well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of <hi>it self,</hi> and the <hi>art of Tilling</hi> is <hi>Ʋseless:</hi> That Man being of a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature, therefore it signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to teach him the <hi>Art of Logick</hi> and Right Reasoning: That his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> having made him a sociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and endu'd him with all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualities for Conversation and Business, therefore he need not trouble his Brain about <hi>Morality,</hi> or <hi>Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks,</hi> or <hi>Politicks:</hi> That <hi>God</hi> having blessed him with the use of <hi>Speech</hi> and the Faculty of <hi>Reason,</hi> therefore 'tis needless for him to study how to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:173675:36"/> himself with Purity and Politeness, or the <hi>Art of Speaking</hi> in the most plausible manner of persuasion. And certainly they would be much in the right on't, if the <hi>Earth</hi> were as Fertile in <hi>one place</hi> as it is in <hi>another,</hi> or if <hi>Ly-ground</hi> and Land that lays untill'd would bring forth as good fruit, and as much on't too, as <hi>Arable,</hi> or that which is cultivated with <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry:</hi> If <hi>nature</hi> were equally <hi>reasonable</hi> and regular in <hi>all Men;</hi> if they had the same capacities, and were all alike free from imperfection and <hi>Non-sense;</hi> if one Man could reason as well as another, without knowing any thing of the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Argument;</hi> if <hi>this Man's</hi> conduct and temper were as discreet as his neighbour's either in sacred, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Secular Societies, and <hi>that Man's example</hi> were as good as <hi>this Man</hi>'s <hi>Praecept:</hi> If they all spake alike, or had the faculty of <hi>talking</hi> with the same Purity and Power of Persuasion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of any <hi>Art.</hi> But there's a great deal of <hi>Invention</hi> wanting to bring things to this Perfection. For as to the <hi>Earth,</hi> it is not all alike fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over the face of the World. <hi>Some
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:173675:37"/> ground</hi> is barren and produces nothing at all; and some next to nothing, brings forth only <hi>Wild Briers</hi> and <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Thiftles</hi> and <hi>Thorns;</hi> and the <hi>Best</hi> that is, stands in need of being <hi>till'd</hi> with labour and improv'd according to the <hi>rules</hi> of <hi>Good Husbandry.</hi> As to <hi>Men</hi> indeed, they all reason well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things in some measure; but not so well as they might do, one would think, being endued both with Reason and Understanding: So that it is necessary to assist <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Art,</hi> both to teach <hi>those people</hi> the true way of reasoning that know nothing on't, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <hi>those</hi> to a felicity of argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>do</hi> know it and yet lay things but very oddly together. They all live well in <hi>Publick Societies</hi> generally speaking, as they are sociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but in <hi>private ones;</hi> particular <hi>Neighbourhoods, Callings</hi> and <hi>Capacities,</hi> they many times behave themselves very untowardly, one against another. And therefore the <hi>Praecepts</hi> of <hi>Moral Philosophy</hi> are both very useful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to reform them, and to teach them <hi>Better Manners.</hi> They all have the <hi>right use of speaking</hi> too; but most
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:173675:37"/> Men do not <hi>speak so well</hi> as might be wished for, upon extraordinary occasions, to persuade people and to convince all that <hi>hear</hi> them, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Truth and Justice: So that they stand in need of being furnish'd with the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to speak fine▪ and agreeably, to express themselves to <hi>Perfection,</hi> and to come off at last with <hi>success</hi> and <hi>applause.</hi> Now, <hi>Action</hi> lays under as great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages as <hi>Nature.</hi> Every one has his particular phancy, as his own <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> or other Men's Examples lead him to't. But some have a way of <hi>speaking</hi> and <hi>moving</hi> far more proper to please the Eye, charm the Ear, and move the Passions, than others <hi>have.</hi> Hence came the <hi>Antients</hi> to take notice of those excellent <hi>Orators</hi> that were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for this faculty: And finding that, by this means, they were much better <hi>heard,</hi> and convinced people far more powerfully than others did, they have carefully observed whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was most Genteel, Delicate and Charming in their <hi>Voyce</hi> and their <hi>Air.</hi> They have likewise, upon considering the Reason and Force of their <hi>Action,</hi>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:173675:38"/> the <hi>Graecians</hi> or the <hi>Romans.</hi> For the first and second time <hi>Demosthenes</hi> pleaded at <hi>Athens</hi> in his natural way of <hi>speaking,</hi> without observing any <hi>rule of the Voyce,</hi> he was <hi>hissed</hi> for his <hi>bad Delivery,</hi> and the remarkable vices of his <hi>Pronunciation;</hi> but after he had been trained up to it a while under <hi>Masters of the Art,</hi> he was <hi>heard</hi> with universal applause and <hi>Humm'd</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: And 'tis as clear as day, that it was <hi>Action</hi> did his business; for <hi>Aeschines</hi> having once recited to the <hi>Rhodians</hi> a Speech which this Great <hi>Orator</hi> had made against him, and seeing them admire it one and all. <hi>Well,</hi> said he; <hi>And how would you have admired it then, if you had heard it from his own mouth. Cicero</hi> again, when he first put himself upon <hi>Pleading</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> was mightily commended and cryed up for a very fine Wit; but his <hi>Delivery</hi> was <hi>Naught,</hi> and his way of <hi>speaking</hi> did not <hi>take</hi> at all; because he kept neither to <hi>Rule</hi> nor <hi>Measure</hi> with his <hi>Voyce,</hi> and his sounds were very harsh and unpleasant. But when he had polished off this <hi>Roughness;</hi> and by the help of his <hi>Tutors,</hi> had refined
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:173675:39"/> his <hi>Pronunciation</hi> to the utmost degree of Perfection, he was preferred on all hands, before the most Eminent <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> of his Standing. He over-ruled every thing afterwards in the Courts of <hi>Judicature,</hi> and for the most part gained what Point soever he pleased there, upon the Honour and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his <hi>Pleading.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all <hi>this</hi> now, can any Man have the face to say that <hi>these Praecepts</hi> of <hi>Action</hi> are either <hi>unprofitable</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary?</hi> and will not the whole world grant me that it is worth while to know and observe them? For, can a Man take too much pains to be <hi>Eloquent?</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Directions for <hi>Action,</hi> to <hi>young Men</hi> that have a mind to study how to <hi>speak well</hi> in Publick.</head>
               <p>I Writ <hi>this little Tract</hi> of <hi>Action</hi> chiefly for <hi>young Gentlemen</hi> that devote themselves either to the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit</hi> or to the <hi>Barr,</hi> and I come now to shew them how <hi>necessary</hi> an <hi>Art</hi> it is; but I think my self oblig'd by the way to give them <hi>two Directions,</hi> that may be very serviceable to their study, and make them good proficients, with a little pains and exercise.</p>
               <p>My <hi>first advice</hi> then is this; that they begin to study it <hi>betimes,</hi> and betake themselves to the <hi>practice</hi> of it as often as they can conveniently, for fear of falling into the imperfections and vices of <hi>speaking</hi> that are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded. It is an easie matter for them
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:173675:40"/> at first to prevent an <hi>odd way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> and an <hi>ill fashioned Gesture,</hi> before they have taken any <hi>biass</hi> or nature stands <hi>a-bend</hi> upon't; but when they have once got an <hi>ungenteel habit,</hi> and confirmed it by <hi>Custom,</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> too, it is very difficult at least, not to say impossible, either for <hi>them</hi> ever to <hi>unlearn</hi> it again, or for <hi>me</hi> to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teach</hi> it: So that they must make it the business of their <hi>youth</hi> up to years of descretion and employment. That's the <hi>Time</hi> when <hi>Nature</hi> is fittest to be wrought upon by <hi>Art;</hi> when it is most docible and apt to recieve the Impressions of Education. They are not to put it off to any other Age, when <hi>Nature</hi> will be hardened and grown more inflexible. 'Tis true when they come to <hi>Maturity</hi> and <hi>Manhood,</hi> they will best know their own Failings, and the Imperfections they labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but then perhaps let 'em repent never so much on't, the misfortune will be past Cure, or else it will be too late for <hi>Men</hi> to think of <hi>refining</hi> at <hi>Thirty</hi> or <hi>Forty.</hi> There's no discipline can correct an over-grown Error, no recovery of Time that is Lost, and no
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173675:40"/>
                  <hi>Remedy</hi> against the <hi>Register.</hi> For the purpose: It will not be impertinent to tell you that I have found many <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Persons</hi> who came too late to the knowledge of the Rules of this Art, lay it extremely to heart that they had not the good fortune to fall upon't soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in an <hi>Age,</hi> when they might have made some progress in it: And <hi>one</hi> I knew among the rest, that had extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary good natural Parts, and was excellently qualifi'd to <hi>speak</hi> in a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Character;</hi> but he had never kept up to any <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Measure,</hi> either in his <hi>Speaking</hi> or <hi>Gesture:</hi> So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he found out his own Faults and Infirmities at last by the help of a Friend that taught him <hi>this Art,</hi> he durst not yet venture upon mending the matter at <hi>that Age</hi> of <hi>Habit,</hi> for fear of losing his labour; and so he despair'd ever to do any good on't. But certainly he had all the reason in the world for his resolution; for he would never have had any success in it, through the natural violence, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and confidence of his temper; and the <hi>rules</hi> he should have been ty'd-up to, would not only have <hi>cramped</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:173675:41"/> him intolerably, but also spoyled his chief Talent and Excellency, which was the <hi>Boldness</hi> and the <hi>Freedom</hi> of his <hi>speaking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My <hi>next Caution</hi> is for <hi>young People,</hi> that are naturally bent upon <hi>Imitation,</hi> and especially the <hi>Imitation</hi> of those Persons that brought them up, as their <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Tutors,</hi> who are most in their thoughts and best in their Opinions; to take care lest they imitate them in <hi>things</hi> contrary to <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> For they ought to examine the practice of their <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> as well as <hi>other Men,</hi> by the <hi>Rules</hi> of this <hi>Art of Speaking</hi> and <hi>Gesture;</hi> as they are bound to enquire into their <hi>Morals</hi> and to distinguish their <hi>honest actions</hi> from <hi>disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest ones</hi> by the <hi>Word of God</hi> and the <hi>Principles of Morality;</hi> with a design to fly the <hi>Bad</hi> and follow the <hi>Good. Young Gentlemen,</hi> I say, ought to take great care in this matter, because <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> often imitate their <hi>Fathers</hi> in the <hi>one</hi> as well as the <hi>other,</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing upon the quality of their Manners. Witness <hi>Young Alcibiades</hi> that follow'd his Father's steps to a <hi>Fault.</hi> He imitated him in <hi>speaking
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173675:41"/> fast and thick,</hi> one word crippling another. He <hi>toss'd up his Head,</hi> and <hi>turn'd his Neck a-skew</hi> like <hi>him</hi> too; and <hi>walk'd the streets a-trip,</hi> as softly as <hi>he</hi> did, with the sweeping train of a <hi>Gown</hi> at his Heels, out of Pride, Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Affectation: as <hi>Archippus,</hi> a <hi>Poet</hi> in those days, hit him once in the Teeth on't. <hi>Scholars</hi> indeed have commonly so great an Esteem and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for their <hi>Masters,</hi> that they are too apt to admire and to practice their <hi>Vices</hi> as well as their <hi>Virtues.</hi> So we read that <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Scholars</hi> imitated his Clownish way of <hi>shrugging up his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s affected his <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering.</hi> Thus likewise <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> imitated <hi>Leonidas</hi> his Governour's Example, in making too swift <hi>marches,</hi> and in fatiguing his Army to death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most upon Exploit and Victory; and he could never break himself on't. And if there's any <hi>Tutor</hi> in a <hi>Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi> happens to have an <hi>Impediment</hi> in his <hi>Speech; wheezes,</hi> as if he had got a <hi>Burr</hi> in his Throat, <hi>snuffles</hi> through the <hi>Nose,</hi> or pronounces several words and letters very <hi>unhandsomely;</hi> not to say <hi>worse;</hi> you shall find his <hi>Pupills</hi> for the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:173675:42"/> most part take at him, and contract the same vices by <hi>imitation:</hi> And why? because he is the pattern of all their <hi>Actions,</hi> Good or <hi>Bad,</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction. The same objection lays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>imitation</hi> of other <hi>Great Men</hi> too; who are not without their <hi>fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> let 'em be never so well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and accomplished. Every Man of us has his weak side. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. <hi>M. Brisson</hi> the <hi>President, says Monsicur du Vair,</hi> was a Man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Learning and Parts, and had the best Faculties in the World for Eloquence; but his <hi>Action</hi> was naught: He stood <hi>always</hi> in the <hi>same Posture;</hi> was <hi>starch'd</hi> and <hi>stiff-neck'd;</hi> lift up his Eyes, and fix'd 'em upon <hi>Heaven</hi> as if he had been going to Prayers; which some People say he did for fear of being diverted from his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and disturbed in his Memory by the variety of <hi>Objects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Young Men</hi> would do well to apply themselves as much as possible to the <hi>Perfections</hi> of such Great Persons as these; but for the <hi>Faults</hi> they find intermixt with their Good Qualities, they must have a care
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:173675:42"/> of running away with <hi>them</hi> too; lest they set up for <hi>their Action,</hi> as the noisie followers of <hi>Seneca</hi> did for <hi>his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi> He was a very brave Man, and a very Great Wit, no doubt on't; so that the <hi>young people</hi> in his days had good reason to study to be like <hi>him,</hi> and to follow so fine an <hi>Example.</hi> But as <hi>Quintilian</hi> says, he had a great many <hi>good faults;</hi> and it was his <hi>agreeable vices</hi> they chiefly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to <hi>imitate,</hi> because they found the least difficulty in it, and what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was the most easiy was the most of their business. Besides, says he, when <hi>they</hi> took upon them to speak as <hi>he</hi> did, instead of doing him an <hi>Honour</hi> or a piece of Justice, they did but do him a Diskindness, and <hi>defamed</hi> him with their Affectation and Foppery. There are <hi>many others</hi> yet, now-a-days, not only among <hi>Young Students,</hi> but also among <hi>Men</hi> who are come to years of Discretion and Government, and <hi>Men of Sense</hi> too, that commit the same <hi>Error.</hi> They think the <hi>Vices</hi> of their Language sufficiently <hi>warranted</hi> by the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:173675:43"/> of so Great a Man as <hi>Seneca,</hi> and their Style current enough by his way of <hi>Writing.</hi> But we must be govern'd in this matter, as in every thing else, by <hi>Reason;</hi> and not be led away by <hi>Example.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of <hi>Speaking;</hi> and, first of all, what the <hi>Orator</hi> must do to be <hi>Heard</hi> without <hi>Difficulty</hi> and <hi>Trouble.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe first thing to be considered in <hi>this Treatise</hi> is <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> or <hi>Speaking,</hi> as it regards the satisfaction of the <hi>Ear;</hi> which is called the <hi>Organ of Learning,</hi> or the <hi>Sense of Discipline:</hi> That is to say; it is the <hi>Hearing</hi> which conveys the <hi>first principles</hi> of all <hi>Sciences</hi> and the <hi>praecepts</hi> of all <hi>Arts</hi> to the <hi>Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave to say then, that the <hi>Orators</hi> chief business ought to be to <hi>Speak,</hi> in his Place, so as to be <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>understood</hi> with <hi>ease.</hi> For if he were not <hi>heard</hi> at all, he'd <hi>speak</hi> to <hi>no purpose;</hi> and if he were not <hi>well
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:173675:44"/> heard,</hi> without <hi>difficulty,</hi> he'd lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these two disadvantages. The one is, that People would be unwilling to give themselves the <hi>trouble</hi> of <hi>hearing</hi> him; for whatever is difficult to the <hi>Ear,</hi> must needs be <hi>heard</hi> with <hi>Chagrin</hi> and Impatience, because it requires so much attention: And then again, the <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> that <hi>could</hi> have the patience <hi>for a while,</hi> would without doubt be haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued quite out of humour, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from <hi>hearing him out,</hi> if this forced attention were to hold for any <hi>long time.</hi> The other disadvantage would be this; that when the <hi>Ear</hi> were at so much Pains to make out his <hi>words,</hi> the <hi>mind</hi> would be so much the <hi>less at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive</hi> to the <hi>matter</hi> of his <hi>Discourse,</hi> which is always the best worth our while and our <hi>hearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to avoid both those inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, he had need have a <hi>clear</hi> and a <hi>strong Voyce:</hi> If not to the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection that <hi>Trachallus</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173675:44"/> understood and commended not only by the <hi>first</hi> where he <hi>pleaded,</hi> but by <hi>all Four;</hi> such a <hi>Voyce</hi> at least he should have, as would fill the <hi>place</hi> where he <hi>speaks.</hi> For, St. <hi>Austin</hi> very well observes, that the <hi>Voyce</hi> ought to be so loud as to reach the farthest Ear of the <hi>Auditory.</hi> Some Men have such a <hi>Voyce</hi> naturally; others have it only partly by <hi>Nature</hi> and partly by <hi>Art,</hi> as they perfect the <hi>one</hi> by the exercice of the <hi>other;</hi> and some again have it not at all, nor know which way in the world to attain to't. Now he that <hi>Nature</hi> hath endued with this faculty to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Eminent, has a great <hi>gift</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question for <hi>Speaking,</hi> and is in a fair way to make an <hi>Eloquent Man;</hi> if he do but discharge his own Duty and emprove so good a Talent to the best advantage. But on the other hand, if <hi>Nature</hi> has given a Man no such bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and his <hi>Voyce</hi> be good for nothing, through some <hi>Indisposition of his Organs,</hi> either of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> the <hi>Throat,</hi> the <hi>Breast</hi> or the <hi>Lungs;</hi> or if he have any notorious <hi>Lisping</hi> and invincible <hi>Hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> or <hi>Stammering</hi> in his Speech, I cannot advise him better than <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:173675:45"/> the <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> did those <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> that would have learned <hi>this Art</hi> of him. For as soon as he saw they wanted the <hi>natural Endowments</hi> that were absolutely necessary to qualifie them for the work, he pronounced upon their <hi>incapacity,</hi> and declared for their studying something else; rather than beat their Brains about an exercice which was not in the <hi>Art of Man</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> them with Credit or Success, and run the risque of forcing <hi>Nature</hi> to the prejudice of their <hi>Health;</hi> which next to their very <hi>Being</hi> was the most valuable thing under the Sun, and the greatest good they had to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
               <p>However yet, if he have all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parts</hi> and Powers of <hi>Oratory,</hi> and wants only <hi>this one Qualification,</hi> I would have him make use of his Talent and do as <hi>Isocrates</hi> did under the same Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of <hi>Speaking,</hi> who excelled in every thing else but his <hi>Voyce. I knew,</hi> says he, <hi>in his PANATHENAICON, that my</hi> Nature <hi>was too Weak and too Soft for</hi> Action, <hi>and my</hi> Voyce <hi>too Feeble and Puny to</hi> Speak <hi>as I should do upon</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:173675:45"/> Publick Affairs. <hi>I found my self unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, in this respect, for</hi> Harangue; <hi>and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t bragged more of their Faculties and Knowledge; though not of speaking them so well off the Lip in a Great</hi> Assembly. <hi>For I want the two main things that do the work of an Orator among us,</hi> Voyce <hi>and</hi> Confidence, <hi>as much as my</hi> Neighbours; <hi>and</hi> they <hi>that are not furnished-out with these Excellencies, are of no Esteem in the World. However I had so much Courage left yet, that I could not bring my self to resolve upon leading a life of Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Dishonour: So that being unfit for managing the business of</hi> Law, <hi>and no ways qualified for</hi> Publick Employment, <hi>I be-took my self to the Private Study of</hi> Wisdom, <hi>and to write my sense of things, not upon such little Subjects as</hi> Deeds, Bargains, Covenants <hi>or</hi> Contracts <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Man and Man; but upon the</hi> State <hi>of</hi> Greece, <hi>upon the</hi> Publick Affairs <hi>of</hi> Government <hi>and of</hi> Kings.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Case,</hi> let him take my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and follow the <hi>Example</hi> of that Great <hi>Orator;</hi> and though he cannot
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:173675:46"/> set-off his <hi>Harangues</hi> with the Graces of <hi>Good Speaking</hi> and <hi>Gesture,</hi> I would advise him to make a mends for that failing by <hi>Figures</hi> that adorn the <hi>Speech</hi> and soften the sound of words; by fine Turns of Expression; by the Elegant number of <hi>Oratory</hi> and the delicate Cadences of his <hi>Periods:</hi> So that his <hi>Discourses,</hi> like <hi>Isocrates</hi>'s, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable enough of <hi>themselves,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Action;</hi> or without being <hi>Read</hi> with much <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Study.</hi> But the Man that lays under no greater <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment</hi> then of having only a <hi>weak Voyce,</hi> need not despaire, nor be discouraged from attempting to <hi>Speak</hi> upon <hi>Publick Occasions,</hi> but ought to do what he can rather to strengthen it up and accomplish it for that <hi>purpose. Demosthenes</hi> did so, and gained his point too. However, <hi>Plutarch</hi> says in his <hi>Life,</hi> that he had naturally a <hi>weak Voyce,</hi> an <hi>Impediment</hi> in his <hi>Speech,</hi> a <hi>Short-Breath;</hi> and yet he ventured in spite of <hi>Fate</hi> and all his <hi>failings,</hi> to <hi>speak</hi> publickly <hi>twice:</hi> But he was <hi>hissed</hi> both times. He adds also, that the <hi>Orator</hi> being discountenanced by the bad suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, made his Complaint to <hi>Satyrus,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:173675:46"/> to this Effect: <hi>That he took more pains than any Orator of 'em all, and could never yet please people.</hi> Why, <hi>says Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrus,</hi> take no thought, Man: I'll mend that matter presently, I warrant you. Upon this he made him repeat some <hi>Verses</hi> out of <hi>Euripides,</hi> or <hi>Sophocles;</hi> which he did, you must think, with a very <hi>ill Grace.</hi> But when he had made such stuff on't, <hi>Satyrus</hi> said the <hi>same Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> after him: and <hi>he</hi> gave them such an <hi>Air</hi> in the Repetition; <hi>Spake</hi> them with an <hi>Accent</hi> and a <hi>Gesture</hi> so suitable to the <hi>Subject,</hi> that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> himself thought them quite another thing, and discovered his own Failing and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. <hi>Eunomus</hi> and <hi>Andronicus,</hi> two Great Masters of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> gave <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> the same Advice too, and the same Encouragement; and after that, he fell upon the Study of this <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Speaking</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> with the utmost Application and Eagerness. Well then! And what came on't at last? Why, first he built him a little <hi>Closet</hi> under-ground, and then he went down thither every day to <hi>practice</hi> his <hi>Voyce</hi> and <hi>manage</hi> his <hi>Body.</hi> He would often stay there two or three months together a-poring
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173675:47"/> upon this Study: and he would shave his Head half-way on purpose, when he had a mind to go abroad either upon Business or Diversion, that he might not appear in the Condition and Dress he was in there. There did he exercise himself with no little <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Force,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>speaking</hi> what he had <hi>read</hi> and what he had <hi>got by Heart,</hi> with a <hi>Loud Voyce:</hi> So that his <hi>Organs</hi> open'd by degrees, and his <hi>Voyce</hi> clear'd-up very sensibly and grew stronger every day than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But he had many other great difficulties to encounter yet besides <hi>this.</hi> His <hi>Tongue</hi> was so <hi>Gross,</hi> that he could not <hi>speak</hi> his words <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Distinct,</hi> nor pronounce some Letters at all; as the (R) in particular: Which made peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple say in a <hi>Joke,</hi> that he knew not so much as how to pronounce the first Letter of the name of his <hi>Art.</hi> He was so <hi>short-winded,</hi> in the next place, that he could <hi>speak</hi> but a very few words <hi>together</hi> without taking his <hi>breath</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on't; which was a <hi>Resty</hi> and a <hi>Broken-winded</hi> kind of <hi>Pronunciation.</hi> The <hi>great noise</hi> of <hi>Assemblies</hi> before which he was to <hi>speak,</hi> was another difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173675:47"/> this, he found out a way to overcome every one of <hi>these obstructions.</hi> First, he cured the <hi>grossness</hi> of his <hi>Tongue</hi> by putting <hi>Pebble-stones</hi> in his <hi>Mouth</hi> that he pick't-up out of the purling Stream; which was a very troublesome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, and hindered his <hi>Speech</hi> mightily at first; but afterwards, when he came to practice without <hi>Pebbles</hi> in his <hi>Mouth,</hi> he found the good effects of it in the <hi>Liberty</hi> of his <hi>Tongue</hi> and the <hi>Facility</hi> of <hi>Speaking.</hi> He brake himself of <hi>breathing-short,</hi> in the next place, by <hi>running up-hill</hi> and repeating over certain <hi>Verses</hi> or some <hi>Sentences</hi> of his <hi>Harangues</hi> that he had by <hi>Heart,</hi> bolt upright as he went; which strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Lungs</hi> and made him <hi>long-winded.</hi> And last of all, he conquer'd the <hi>cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> of <hi>Assemblies,</hi> by going now and then to the <hi>Sea-shore,</hi> when it was most troubled, boysterous, and roaring at <hi>Full-Sea; saying off</hi> some or other of his <hi>Orations</hi> there <hi>aloud,</hi> and striving to raise his <hi>Voyce</hi> above the murmuring noise of the <hi>Waves.</hi> So that, in fine, he made himself absolute Master of <hi>Speaking.</hi> And for <hi>Gesture,</hi> he took this method, after he was well instructed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:173675:48"/> in the <hi>Praecepts</hi> and Exercice of it: He had a great <hi>Looking-glass</hi> made him, where he might see all his <hi>Shapes</hi> at once in full <hi>Proportion</hi> and <hi>Symmetry;</hi> and know how to correct every <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Posture</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> which transgress'd the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> that his <hi>Masters</hi> had taught him, by the help of so Just a <hi>Reflexion.</hi> By this means, he became at last one of the <hi>Best Speakers</hi> of the Age he liv'd in, for <hi>Action</hi> as well as for all the <hi>other parts</hi> of <hi>Oratory.</hi> Well then <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> Imitate <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> towards the accomplishing of this work. Do but give your selves <hi>so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> as the thing will require, and your <hi>Nature</hi> will easily bear up to't, and i'll warrant the rest, both for Success and Applause.

               <p>Have you a <hi>weak voyce</hi> then? Make it your business to <hi>fortifie</hi> it as much as possible. Whatever you <hi>Read</hi> or get <hi>off-Book,</hi> speak it out a loud, and make it your own by <hi>Pronunciation.</hi> This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercice, if it be moderate, is very good for your <hi>health;</hi> but you must have a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:173675:48"/> special care at first not to <hi>over-strain</hi> your <hi>Voyce.</hi> And therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> very well recommends several <hi>Exercices of Body</hi> to other People, that may conduce to the <hi>Health</hi> as well as <hi>divert;</hi> but he appoints no other for those Persons that <hi>speak</hi> upon <hi>publick occasions,</hi> than what their <hi>Profession</hi> obliges them to in course: That is, to be often <hi>discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> and <hi>haranguing,</hi> or at least <hi>reading out a loud</hi> and raising up the <hi>Voyce</hi> as <hi>High</hi> as <hi>Nature</hi> will well bear.

                  </hi> accustom your self in your <hi>private Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> and <hi>Rehearsals,</hi> to pronounce your Words and Syllables so <hi>distinctly,</hi> one after another, that they may all have their <hi>full Sound</hi> and <hi>Proportion.</hi> And when once you have got a <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>speaking</hi> intelligibly <hi>plain,</hi> you may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards express your self more <hi>flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,</hi> wihout <hi>maffling</hi> through a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But do you find it a difficult matter to avoid this fault of <hi>Stammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in some cases, as upon <hi>set forms</hi> of <hi>Speaking</hi> or <hi>Phrases</hi> that you commonly make use of? Why then, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwise bring your business about,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:173675:49"/> as 'tis impossible for some <hi>Stuttering Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to do't; it is but changing the <hi>Order</hi> of the words, inserting a smooth Particle or two, and putting a <hi>Synonomous</hi> word in here and there for that which made you <hi>faulter;</hi> and you'll gain your point with the greatest facility imaginable.</p>
               <p>If you cannot pronounce the <hi>Letter</hi> (R), after all the pains you have taken to master the weakness, and think it in vain to attempt it against a <hi>natural incapacity,</hi> you are not to give it over yet for an <hi>impossibility,</hi> but to use all means within the power of <hi>Nature</hi> and of <hi>Art,</hi> to correct the Error and conquer the Difficulty. For although the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that had so <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Delicate</hi> an <hi>Ear,</hi> could endure this Imperfection in <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi> it was either out of the fond Affection and Favour they had for his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or because he had some other Charms in his <hi>Pronunciation</hi> to make amends for't, and they thought that it gave a certain Natural Grace and Attraction to whatsoever he said. But if <hi>Stammering</hi> be a <hi>vice</hi> for all that, which very much offends the Ear, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Expression often <hi>Ambiguous</hi> to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:173675:50"/> the understanding, and is made the subject of <hi>Raillery</hi> and <hi>Ridicule,</hi> (as the <hi>Poets</hi> of those days give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it was laugh'd at in the <hi>Theatre</hi> of <hi>Athens:</hi>) we ought to endeavour the correction of it for our own Interest, and need not despaire either of Power or Capacity to do it, by good Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and constant Practice. Thus <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> industriously refined his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation</hi> of the (R), and thus may <hi>you</hi> as well perfect yours too if you please. And if this do not come up to your Poynt of pronouncing <hi>that Letter</hi> round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the utmost Liberty and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the World; provided yet that you do but pronounce it <hi>indifferently well,</hi> in some degree only of Perfection, it will be sufficient perhaps to estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish you a Reputation of having the <hi>Grace</hi> on't among some or other of your <hi>Hearers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are <hi>some persons</hi> again that are affected with <hi>another vice,</hi> which the <hi>Greek Rhetoricians</hi> call <hi>Plateasm:</hi> That is to say; a <hi>Broad way of Speaking</hi> with the mouth wide open, and of bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a great sound, but nothing so
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:173675:50"/> confused and inarticulate as the noise of it: Insomuch that a Man may hear them a great way off with ease, but understand no more of their <hi>Bawling</hi> than of the <hi>Bruit</hi> of <hi>Wild Beasts.</hi> Now this is not <hi>Nature's Fault,</hi> but a <hi>Vice</hi> of <hi>meer Affectation</hi> and <hi>Conceit.</hi> For these <hi>noisy People</hi> affect to speak <hi>open-mouth,</hi> and phancy that this thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Clatt</hi> of <hi>theirs</hi> gives Power and Majesty to their <hi>Speech:</hi> But, on the contrary, 'tis this deprives it of it's greatest Virtue and Perfection, which is to be well <hi>Heard</hi> every word on't, and well <hi>understood</hi> in all it's Parts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it robs it of it's very <hi>Being</hi> a <hi>Speech</hi> too; for there's not a <hi>Word</hi> in it, but only an <hi>Inarticulate Huddle</hi> of Sound and <hi>Voyce.</hi> And where's the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution of unintelligible <hi>Gibberidge?</hi> We must therefore take care to avoid this way of <hi>Speaking</hi> that renders a <hi>Discourse</hi> as contemptible to the <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as it is Unprofitable to the <hi>Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> For <hi>five</hi> or <hi>six Words</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced O'this fashion must needs make us lose the <hi>Sense</hi> of a <hi>whole Sentence,</hi> and many <hi>Sentences</hi> so <hi>ill Spoken</hi> and so <hi>ill Heard</hi> must needs endanger the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173675:51"/> of a <hi>whole Discourse:</hi> So that a Man can carry nothing away with him, either of <hi>neat</hi> or of <hi>perfect,</hi> from such a Clamorous <hi>Harangue</hi> and so Clownish a piece of <hi>Jargon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's another <hi>vice of Speaking</hi> yet quite contrary to the former, which the Graecians have called <hi>Coelostomy.</hi> It consists in <hi>Mumbling,</hi> when a Man does not open his mouth <hi>wide enough</hi> for his <hi>Words.</hi> He makes a confounded <hi>noise rumbling</hi> about the Roof of his Mouth, as if he were speaking out of a <hi>Cave</hi> or a <hi>Churn,</hi> but hardly ever sends forth one <hi>distinct Sound</hi> all the while on this side his <hi>Teeth,</hi> or conveys you one <hi>Articulate Word</hi> farther than his <hi>Lips:</hi> And this hollow way of <hi>Speaking</hi> is no less troublesome and disagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than that above mention'd.</p>
               <p>I am now to advance only <hi>two words</hi> more upon the <hi>Orators Care</hi> to be <hi>Heard</hi> and <hi>Ʋnderstood</hi> without difficulty. <hi>First,</hi> there are two things requisite to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Man for this Work: That is, a very <hi>Distinct</hi> and <hi>Articulate Voyce,</hi> and a very <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>Vigorous Pronunciation;</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:173675:51"/> but the <hi>former</hi> is the more important and necessary of the <hi>Two.</hi> For a Man that has only an <hi>indifferent Voyce,</hi> if his <hi>Pronunciation</hi> be but Distinct, he shall be understood with far more ease than another that has a stronger and more Audible Faculty of <hi>Speaking,</hi> but does not <hi>articulate</hi> his words so well. For the purpose, I have the Honour to be acquainted with a <hi>Worthy Person</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Threescore years of Age</hi> or upwards, that speaks in a Publick Character; and though he always had but a very <hi>mean Voyce,</hi> yet because he <hi>pronounces</hi> his Words so <hi>distinctly,</hi> without losing the <hi>Sound</hi> of a <hi>Syllable,</hi> he's always <hi>Heard</hi> with Admiration, and <hi>understood</hi> with the greatest facility in Nature: And that to this day too, unless his <hi>Organs</hi> have failed him very much within these few years, and be grown too weak for an <hi>Auditory,</hi> through the Infirmities of Old Age. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the next thing required is an <hi>Aud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ble</hi> and a <hi>strong Voyce;</hi> and we must not think to acquire it all on a sudden nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by main strength or intemperate violences upon <hi>Nature,</hi> but to come to't by degrees. For so the <hi>Voyce</hi> which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173675:52"/> at first was <hi>Faint, Low,</hi> or <hi>Weak,</hi> will become <hi>Louder</hi> by little and little, and grow <hi>Stronger</hi> insensibly, by accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves to the moderate exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Art;</hi> without doing any prejudice either to the <hi>Breast</hi> or the <hi>Lungs.</hi> By this means, in short, a Man may bring his <hi>Voyce</hi> at last to that Pitch of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which he never thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self able to Accomplish.</p>

               <p>IT is not enough for the Orator to be <hi>Heard</hi> only without <hi>difficulty</hi> and <hi>pain,</hi> but he must endeavour to be <hi>Heard</hi> also, if possible, with <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi> And therefore you must make it your main <hi>business,</hi> in the first place, to render your <hi>Voyce</hi> as <hi>Sweet</hi> and <hi>Soft,</hi> and <hi>Agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Ear</hi> as you can: So that if you be naturally inclined to any thing either of a <hi>Harsh, Hoarse</hi> or <hi>Obstreperous Voyce,</hi> you must enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cause on't for a cure. And if you find it comes only from an <hi>Ill Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> you have got, or so; you ought to take up a resolution of <hi>unpractising</hi> it as soon as possible, and of running up a <hi>Counter-Custom</hi> against it, of better Service and Satisfaction to the <hi>Publick.</hi> But if you discover that it proceeds
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:173675:53"/> from some <hi>Natural Indisposition</hi> of your <hi>Body</hi> and the <hi>Organs</hi> of your <hi>Voyce,</hi> you must then try to recover it, as well by sobriety and good <hi>Regimen</hi> according to the Advice of your <hi>Physicians,</hi> as by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and constant exercice. As for <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

But that <hi>this Art</hi> of <hi>Softening</hi> and <hi>Timing</hi> of the <hi>Pronunciation</hi> may be acquired by care, Industry and Exercice, it is plain from the example of <hi>Cicero,</hi> to a Conviction: For <hi>Plutarch</hi> says in his <hi>Life,</hi> that he had at first a very <hi>Rude</hi> and <hi>Obstrepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Voyce,</hi> before he went into <hi>Greece,</hi> but by staying <hi>there</hi> a while, he brought it to so much <hi>Sweetness</hi> and <hi>Delicacy,</hi> that he charmed the <hi>Ear</hi> with the <hi>Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Sounds</hi> and a most <hi>Agreeable Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> In fine, you must endeavour to give your <hi>Voyce</hi> such a <hi>Smoothness,</hi> that the <hi>Turns,</hi> the <hi>Tones</hi> and the <hi>Soft mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of it may please the <hi>Ear</hi> of your <hi>Auditor,</hi> though he understand nothing at all either of your <hi>Language</hi> or of the

                  <hi>Subject</hi> of your <hi>Discourse:</hi> As <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> tells us of <hi>Phavorinus</hi> the <hi>Sophist</hi> and of <hi>Adrian</hi> the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> that those very Persons who knew nothing of the <hi>Greek Tongue,</hi> took great delight yet to hear them <hi>declame</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> their <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods</hi> were so <hi>Smooth</hi> and their <hi>Cadences</hi> so <hi>Delicate.</hi>

               <p>In the next place, you must also shun <hi>that reigning Vice</hi> among many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of <hi>Coughing</hi> and <hi>Spitting</hi> often, while they are <hi>a Speaking,</hi> which mightily interrupts the <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ungrateful and disagreeable both to the <hi>Eyes</hi> and the <hi>Ears</hi> of the <hi>Hearers.</hi> But that it is not impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to avoid <hi>this vice,</hi> on the one hand, and that it is for the most part an effect rather of an <hi>ill Custom</hi> than of <hi>necessity</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> on the other; is as Plain as experience can make it, because most Men refrain from it: And I know a <hi>Divine</hi> that never <hi>Coughs</hi> nor <hi>Spits</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> when he has got the <hi>greatest Cold</hi> in his Head; 'tis no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he comes to have this Conduct by long <hi>Practice,</hi> or whether it be the <hi>Heat</hi> of his <hi>Action</hi> which stops the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion</hi>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I mean yet that you are to do no more than you <hi>can</hi> to avoid <hi>Hawking</hi> and <hi>Spawling;</hi> for some People are so troubled with <hi>Phlegm</hi> and <hi>Tisick</hi> at certain Times and Seasons of the year, that it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to abstain wholly from one or t'other in their <hi>Preaching:</hi> but they ought to do as much as they <hi>can</hi> at least towards the correcting of so Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly a <hi>Vice,</hi> if they have any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for a decent way of <hi>Speaking,</hi> or would make the <hi>Pronunciation</hi> agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their <hi>Hearers.</hi> But as to the matter of <hi>Coughing,</hi> it was in <hi>Fashion</hi> in former days; and there have been <hi>Preachers</hi> formerly so extravagant as to <hi>affect</hi> it for a thing that added <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Gravity</hi> to their <hi>Discourse.</hi> As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. <hi>Oliver Maillard,</hi> in one of his <hi>Sermons</hi> he made at <hi>Bruges</hi> in the <hi>Year Fifteen Hundred,</hi> mark'd the Places and <hi>Paragraphs</hi> of his <hi>Discourse</hi> with a <hi>Hem, Hem, Hem,</hi> where he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to <hi>Cough</hi> upon't; as it may be seen at <hi>this Day</hi> in <hi>Print.</hi>

               <p>The only thing, after this, I can recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your care and your time, is to put your self upon <hi>varying your Voyce</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of the <hi>Subjects</hi> you are to set forth, of the <hi>Passions</hi> you would either express <hi>your self,</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in <hi>others,</hi> and of the several <hi>parts</hi> of your <hi>Speech;</hi> according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of <hi>Words,</hi> Stronger or Weaker, Higher or Lower, as will best serve <hi>your Turn</hi> and answer <hi>their quality.</hi> For as a <hi>Scraping Fiddler</hi> that should harp always upon <hi>one String,</hi> would be <hi>Ridiculous;</hi> and his <hi>Musick Intolerable:</hi> So there is nothing can grate the <hi>Ear</hi> of your <hi>Auditors</hi> so much, and give them so great a disgust as a <hi>Voyce</hi> still in the <hi>same Key,</hi> to the <hi>Tune</hi> of <hi>Hum-Drum,</hi> without either <hi>Division</hi> or <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</hi> This <hi>Vice</hi> is remarkable in most <hi>Speakers,</hi> and I cannot but take notice on't. There's hardly a <hi>good Voyce</hi> to be found among Men, that fills the <hi>Ear</hi> well, which has not something <hi>agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in't, let them manage it never so much without <hi>measure:</hi> But it would be infinitely more <hi>pleasing,</hi> if they knew how to give it the just <hi>Turns</hi> and a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173675:55"/>
                  <hi>Variation</hi> suitable to <hi>Subjects</hi> and <hi>Passions.</hi> Besides that, such <hi>Voyces,</hi> which are so <hi>fine</hi> and yet so <hi>ill governed,</hi> are very rare and uncommon: But for ordinary ones that are common enough in the World, <hi>this Vice</hi> renders them <hi>disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable</hi> to all Intents and Purposes.</p>
               <p>To pass on further then. I say that this stiff <hi>uniformity</hi> of the <hi>Voyce</hi> is not only unpleasant to the <hi>Ear,</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices the <hi>Discourse</hi> it self extremely too, and disappoints the effect it should have upon the <hi>Hearers,</hi> for two reasons. The <hi>one</hi> is, that an <hi>equal way</hi> of <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> when the <hi>Pronunciation</hi> is all of a <hi>piece</hi> and every where upon the <hi>same Sound,</hi> renders all the Parts of the <hi>Speech equal</hi> too upon a very <hi>unjust le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;</hi> for it takes away all <hi>power</hi> from <hi>that</hi> which has the greatest strength of Argument in the reasoning part, and all <hi>Lustre</hi> from that which has the greatest splendor of ornament in the figurative part of a <hi>Discourse,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Work: So that, in short, <hi>that</hi> which ought to strike the <hi>Passions</hi> most, moves them not at all in effect, because it is spoken all <hi>alike</hi> so, and slab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:173675:55"/> over without any <hi>distinction</hi> or <hi>variety.</hi> The <hi>other,</hi> that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lulls us <hi>a Sleep</hi> sooner, nothing so dull and heavy as a long Discourse without ever turning the <hi>Tone</hi> or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Note</hi> for't: and there are many Persons, although they should fix never so stedfastly upon such a <hi>Speaker</hi> and resolve to hear him with the utmost regard and attention, would not be able yet to hold up their <hi>Eyes</hi> 'till he had <hi>half-done,</hi> upon this deficiency of his <hi>Pronunciation.</hi> And yet, for all this, <hi>Monotony</hi> is not only a <hi>common vice,</hi> but almost <hi>universal</hi> too among <hi>publick Orators.</hi> I was subject to't <hi>my self,</hi> at first, as well as <hi>other Men;</hi> and I cannot imagine how any body could endure to give me the <hi>hearing</hi> upon't; for my <hi>Delivery</hi> then was so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and disagreeable, that I could hardly <hi>reconcile</hi> it to my <hi>own Ears:</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, I bethought my self ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>varying</hi> my <hi>Voyce</hi> several ways to make it less <hi>uniform,</hi> and <hi>ungrateful.</hi> In the first place, I began to consider how this <hi>vicious way</hi> of <hi>Speaking</hi> came to such a height among Men, and crept up so much into <hi>Fashion</hi> and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:173675:56"/>
                  <hi>Discipline;</hi> some people running care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly into it, without ever giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves leave to <hi>think,</hi> and others know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well it is <hi>vicious,</hi> but have much a do to <hi>reform</hi> it: and I could find no other <hi>cause</hi> of it at last, but <hi>bad Education.</hi> For <hi>they</hi> that teach <hi>Children</hi> to read, learn 'em an ill custom of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing every word <hi>a like,</hi> in the same <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Tone;</hi> the fault of most <hi>School-mistresses:</hi> And when <hi>these Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> again advance into <hi>Grammar</hi> or <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> they fall perhaps into no better hands, of <hi>Masters</hi> that teach them their <hi>Rudiments</hi> in the same measure and method, without ever taking care to correct the <hi>ill habit of Speaking</hi> they have got; but rather giving them a bad example <hi>themselves</hi> by <hi>pronouncing</hi> every word they read or say off-book, with the same <hi>Accent,</hi> and quite <hi>another tone</hi> than what we use in our <hi>daily Discourse</hi> and <hi>Common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi> then instructing <hi>Youth</hi> in the <hi>variation</hi> of the <hi>Voyce</hi> for publick bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; how they ought to proportion and adjust their <hi>Pronunciation</hi> upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>punctillo</hi> (when they come to make <hi>Speeches</hi>) to the Grandeur of their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:173675:56"/>
                  <hi>Audience</hi> and the multitude of their <hi>Auditors.</hi> Upon this, I resolved to be governed by <hi>better Masters,</hi> and to make <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> my <hi>Guides:</hi> and they must be your <hi>Masters</hi> too, take my word for't, if you would do any good in this <hi>Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> it self tells us that we ought to pronounce our selves <hi>otherwise</hi> when we speak of <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Things,</hi> then we should do a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-making</hi> upon Joy or Pleasantry; <hi>otherwise,</hi> when we <hi>reprove</hi> people for committing some Great Crime or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than when we are a <hi>comforting</hi> them that are in Affliction; <hi>otherwise,</hi> when we <hi>upbraid</hi> a Man with his <hi>faults,</hi> then when we would <hi>ask Pardon</hi> for our <hi>own; otherwise</hi> again, when we <hi>threaten; otherwise,</hi> when we <hi>promise,</hi> or <hi>pray a thing</hi> and <hi>humbly beg the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; otherwise,</hi> when we are in a <hi>good humour,</hi> the <hi>Passions</hi> calm, and the <hi>Mind</hi> serene; and <hi>otherwise,</hi> when we are upon the <hi>transports</hi> of Choler and ill Nature. This <hi>variation</hi> is so <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> to us, that if we should hear <hi>two persons haranguing</hi> both together in a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:173675:57"/>
                  <hi>Language</hi> we did not understand at all, the <hi>one</hi> in <hi>Anger,</hi> and t'other in <hi>fear, one</hi> of them speaking with <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> with <hi>sorrow:</hi> We might easily <hi>distinguish</hi> the <hi>Passions</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> from the <hi>other,</hi> not only by their <hi>countenance</hi> and their <hi>gesture,</hi> but by the different <hi>Tone</hi> and <hi>Cadence</hi> of the <hi>Voyce.</hi> So that the <hi>pronunciation</hi> ought to be <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and we must do as <hi>Nature</hi> dictates: For the nearer it comes up to <hi>Nature,</hi> the more <hi>perfect</hi> it is; and the further off from it, the more <hi>vicious.</hi> The less <hi>affected,</hi> still the <hi>better;</hi> for a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural variation</hi> is best. The only way then to get <hi>this knack of varying the Voyce,</hi> is to make your own reflections upon common <hi>Chat,</hi> and to take notice of any ordinary <hi>Discourse,</hi> either in <hi>Town</hi> or in <hi>Table-Talk.</hi> You are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to mind how you <hi>Speak your self,</hi> when you are in Company; what a <hi>Woman</hi> says in a Passion for an injury done her, and how she <hi>pronounces</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the loss of her <hi>dear Husband</hi> or her <hi>Child.</hi> And when you have made these <hi>private</hi> Observations, you must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to express your self after the same manner upon the like occasions
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:173675:57"/> in <hi>publick;</hi> only you would do well to distinguish upon the <hi>place,</hi> how much more <hi>audible</hi> your <hi>Voyce</hi> ought to be for the <hi>Court</hi> or a <hi>Church,</hi> than for a <hi>private Chamber.</hi> Our best <hi>Actors</hi> change their <hi>Voyce</hi> thus, according to the different <hi>quality</hi> of <hi>persons</hi> and the <hi>diversity</hi> of <hi>Subjects;</hi> and they speak as <hi>naturally</hi> upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> and in the same <hi>Tone</hi> too, as they would do in a <hi>familiar Club-room;</hi> saving that they are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>accent</hi> their words <hi>louder</hi> there, and to proportion the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence</hi> of their <hi>Voyce</hi> to the vastness of a <hi>Theatre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Reason,</hi> it teaches us, in the first place, that <hi>God Almighty</hi> hath-blessed <hi>Ʋs</hi> with the faculty of <hi>Speech</hi> above all <hi>other Creatures,</hi> and given us <hi>words</hi> for the interpretation of our <hi>Thoughts</hi> and the <hi>Mirrour</hi> or reflection of our <hi>passions:</hi> So that we are under the greatest duty both to <hi>him</hi> and <hi>our selves,</hi> to set forth the naked truth of things, and to express the different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations and sentiments of our Souls, <hi>ingenuously,</hi> by the <hi>different Accents</hi> and <hi>Turns</hi> of our <hi>Voyce,</hi> for the raising of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:173675:58"/> the like Passions and Opinions in <hi>those</hi> that <hi>hear</hi> us. But it shews us also, in the second place, that as <hi>God</hi> in the Creation of the World, in <hi>general,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it into so many several <hi>shapes</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> in the visible Order and Harmony we admire now; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, it would have been but a confus'd <hi>Chaos</hi> still and an indigested <hi>Lump;</hi> and as in the production of our <hi>humane body, in particular,</hi> he made it up of so many <hi>different parts</hi> and <hi>particles,</hi> members of Life and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> without which, it would only have been a monstrous dull <hi>mass</hi> of <hi>Flesh:</hi> So ought we to make use of <hi>variety</hi> to enliven the matter of our <hi>publick Discourses;</hi> not only by <hi>Invention, Disposition</hi> and <hi>Elocution;</hi> but as well also by the Powers of <hi>pronunciation</hi> and speaking.</p>
               <p>Now if we would <hi>polish</hi> and <hi>refine</hi> our <hi>Speech,</hi> and set-off our <hi>pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with so much Grace and Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, that it should <hi>oblige</hi> the <hi>hearers,</hi> even under the greatest prejudices and disgusts, to recollect their <hi>attention</hi> to it with <hi>Relish</hi> and <hi>Delight;</hi> we
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:173675:58"/> must <hi>vary</hi> the <hi>Voyce</hi> as often as it lays in our power. All the difficulty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that remains, is to know <hi>how</hi> to do't; and to do it <hi>well</hi> to the purpose too: Which I am now going to remark into the best <hi>Rules</hi> I can.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> General <hi>Rules</hi> for the <hi>variation</hi> of the <hi>Voyce.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS the <hi>Body</hi> has three dimensions, for it's <hi>Length, Breadth</hi> and <hi>Thickness;</hi> so the <hi>Voyce</hi> has three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal differences, of <hi>Highness</hi> or <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> of <hi>Vehemence</hi> or <hi>Softness,</hi> and of <hi>Swiftness</hi> or <hi>Slowness.</hi> The <hi>Orators</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is to keep up a just <hi>measure</hi> in all these distinctions, and to observe that <hi>variety,</hi> throughout the whole <hi>Speech,</hi> which we have asserted for so necessary a Virtue.</p>
               <p>But the chief thing will be to maintain a true <hi>medium</hi> of the <hi>Voice,</hi> because both the <hi>extremes</hi> of it are <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> And therefore, <hi>first,</hi> with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>height</hi> of it, we must have a care of raising it always to the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Note</hi> it can reach, on the one hand,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:173675:59"/> or of debating it always to the <hi>lowest</hi> it will go, on the other: For to strein it up always to such an extraordinary <hi>height,</hi> would not be to <hi>Preach</hi> or to <hi>Plead,</hi> but to <hi>make a noise,</hi> like those <hi>loud-tongued Orators</hi> in the time of <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> whom he compares to <hi>Cripples</hi> that got a <hi>Horse-back</hi> because they could not walk <hi>a foot: They</hi> made a <hi>bawling</hi> because they knew not how to <hi>Speak.</hi> And as <hi>he</hi> did himself too, before he was better instructed in <hi>this Art</hi> by the skillfulest <hi>Masters;</hi> forcing his <hi>Voyce</hi> often up to the <hi>harshest accents</hi> and the most <hi>obstreperous heights.</hi> For, over and above the indecency and ungenteel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Clamour</hi> and <hi>Noise,</hi> it very much offends the <hi>Throat</hi> of the <hi>Speaker</hi> to a <hi>Hoarseness,</hi> and the <hi>Ears</hi> of the <hi>Hearer</hi> to an <hi>aversion.</hi> To sink the <hi>Voyce</hi> likewise, on the contrary, into the <hi>lowest base,</hi> and keep it always in the <hi>same tone,</hi> would be to <hi>mutter</hi> rather than to <hi>Speak;</hi> and it would make a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>silent meeting,</hi> where a Man could not be <hi>heard</hi> at all, or be <hi>heard</hi> but by a very few people, and the rest of the <hi>Auditors</hi> might go away as they came, not one word the wiser for him. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:173675:60"/> Capella</hi> is mightily mistaken in this Point, or else he explains himself very ill, when he says that the <hi>Orator</hi> ought to set his <hi>Voyce</hi> to the best of his <hi>Ear,</hi> by <hi>reading</hi> to <hi>himself</hi> in private, before he <hi>pleads</hi> in publick, and to <hi>begin</hi> it rather with a <hi>low murmur</hi> than a <hi>loud noise</hi> in his <hi>Chamber,</hi> that he may be able to speak with the same <hi>Voyce</hi> and the same <hi>Tone</hi> in <hi>Court:</hi> For how could <hi>he</hi> be <hi>heard</hi> in a <hi>Great Assembly,</hi> I would fain know, with a <hi>low murmuring Voyce?</hi> There's no <hi>Consort</hi> or <hi>Musick</hi> without keeping a <hi>mean</hi> betwixt <hi>high</hi> and <hi>low, muttering</hi> and making a <hi>noise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>vehemence</hi> of the <hi>Voyce</hi> in the next place, a Man must not force it upon every turn to the <hi>last Extremity.</hi> For he would not be able to hold it long-up to this <hi>violence,</hi> till it would fail him all o'the sudden; like the <hi>Strings</hi> of a <hi>Musical Instrument,</hi> that break when they are wound up a <hi>Pin</hi> too high. In this case, he would either have the same fortune with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> that <hi>Philostratus</hi> speaks of, who suffered himself to be transported into such a <hi>Tragical Fit</hi> of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:173675:60"/>
                  <hi>Speaking,</hi> that he lost his <hi>Voyce</hi> in a moment, and was forced either to hold his <hi>Tongue,</hi> or to mourn it out so <hi>Faint</hi> and so <hi>Low,</hi> that people could hardly hear him and much less under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what he said: Or else, he would run the <hi>risque</hi> of <hi>Zosimus</hi> the <hi>Freeman</hi> of <hi>Pliny Junior;</hi> who having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streined himself with the <hi>violence</hi> of his <hi>Rehearsals,</hi> vomited Blood upon't: So that his <hi>Master</hi> was forc'd to forbid him that Exercice for some time, and made him take a short <hi>Tour</hi> into <hi>Aegypt</hi> for the Recovery of his <hi>Health.</hi> The Country-retirement and good Air set him quickly to rights: but, upon his return, he fell a <hi>Rehearsing</hi> again with the <hi>same vehemence,</hi> and <hi>relapsed</hi> into the <hi>same indisposition</hi> and <hi>danger,</hi> worse than ever.</p>
               <p>A Man of a <hi>Weak Constitution,</hi> and in <hi>Years</hi> especially, ought to beware of this <hi>Intemperance,</hi> for fear of falling into <hi>King Attalus</hi>'s misfortune. He made a <hi>Speech</hi> once at <hi>Thebes,</hi> in a publick <hi>Assembly;</hi> and being transported upon it into an <hi>Action</hi> too <hi>Violent</hi> for his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyness and old Age, he was struck
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:173675:61"/>
                  <hi>Speechless</hi> all on a sudden, without the least <hi>motion</hi> or appearance of <hi>Life</hi> in him, so that he was forced to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>home</hi> to his <hi>Lodging:</hi> But a little while after, he was conducted from <hi>thence</hi> to his <hi>Palace</hi> at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> he Died. On the other hand, an <hi>Orator</hi> ought not to be too <hi>Remiss</hi> neither in his <hi>Action,</hi> nor too <hi>Mild-spoken:</hi> For such a soft resolution of the <hi>Voyce</hi> argues an Infirmity, and too much <hi>mildness</hi> destroys the Energy and Force of a <hi>Speech,</hi> because a <hi>dispassionate Discourse</hi> raises no body's <hi>Affections</hi> a pitch above common <hi>Story</hi> and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Tattle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the <hi>Swiftness</hi> and <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility</hi> of the <hi>Orator</hi>'s <hi>Voyce,</hi> he ought to <hi>moderate</hi> it in such a manner as to avoid all <hi>precipitation;</hi> the <hi>vice</hi> of <hi>Hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> which made <hi>Augustus</hi> say once in <hi>Rallery, There must be a Spoke put in our</hi> Haterius<hi>'s Speech,</hi> comparing his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course for its <hi>rapidity</hi> to a <hi>Flying-Coach</hi> upon the descent of some steep Hill or other: We put <hi>Spokes</hi> in it's <hi>Wheels</hi> then, for fear of running down too fast, and of tumbling or overturning upon

This was <hi>Serapion</hi>'s weak-side also, of whom <hi>Lucilius</hi> wrote thus to <hi>Seneca,</hi> that he spake exceeding <hi>fast</hi> and <hi>thick,</hi> one word upon the neck of another; insomuch that one single Tongue seem'd insufficient to express the vast multitude and hurry of his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> so much did the <hi>Fruitfulness</hi> of his <hi>phancy precipitate</hi> his <hi>Pronunciation.</hi> But this is a <hi>vicious way</hi> of <hi>Speaking</hi> in several respects. For such an extravagant <hi>volubility</hi> is either the fault of a <hi>School-boy,</hi> that, to shew you how perfect he has <hi>conn'd</hi> his <hi>Lesson, gabbles</hi> it off as fast as his <hi>Tongue</hi> can go, in a hurry; or, the faculty of a <hi>Montebanck-Doctor</hi> that would draw a <hi>Crowd</hi> about his <hi>Stage</hi> by <hi>rapid Clack</hi> and <hi>Non-sense:</hi> Not the business of a Man of <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Eloquence</hi> that addresses himself upon a Grave, Solemn and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subject. It is as <hi>ungenteel</hi> for a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to transport himself into such a <hi>Rant</hi> of <hi>Jabbering</hi> in his Discourse, as to run himself out of <hi>Breath</hi> about the <hi>Streets,</hi> which is only fit for <hi>Foot-men</hi> and <hi>Fools.</hi> A Man of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Breeding speaks</hi> no faster than he <hi>Walks,</hi> and minds his <hi>words</hi> as well as his <hi>Steps,</hi> keeping an <hi>even pace</hi> both in the <hi>one</hi> and

For the purpose, <hi>Tacitus</hi> says of <hi>Haterius</hi> above mentioned; that <q rend="margQuotes">He was famous for <hi>Eloquence</hi> in his <hi>Life-time;</hi> but the <hi>Works</hi> he <hi>left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him,</hi> had not the same approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and applause: And as he shew'd more of <hi>Fire</hi> then of <hi>Study,</hi> and more of <hi>Fluency</hi> than of <hi>Art;</hi> so that <hi>Fire</hi> was extinguish'd with him, and never out liv'd his <hi>Speeches</hi> nor passed into
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:173675:62"/> his <hi>Writings.</hi> Whereas the Labours and Meditations of other Men keep up the same <hi>Spirit</hi> still after their <hi>Death</hi> and preserve their <hi>Memories</hi> for ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>vice</hi> is not only very <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming</hi> an <hi>Orator</hi> either a <hi>Preaching</hi> or a <hi>Pleading,</hi> but it is also very prejudicial to the main end he ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to <hi>himself,</hi> of <hi>persuading others:</hi> For how should he convince his <hi>hearers,</hi> if he do not give them <hi>time</hi> to think, or <hi>leave</hi> to consider his Reasons and weigh his Arguments? How should a <hi>Judge</hi> be able to keep up with a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi> that talks as if he were <hi>Riding Post;</hi> or what better can he be for such a <hi>precipitated Plea?</hi> How should people ever remember one Reason in Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that are hurled upon their <hi>Ears</hi> at this rate, like <hi>Flashes of Lightening</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Eyes;</hi> or how should they be convinced at last of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi> by <hi>Jabbering?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This extraordinary <hi>volubility</hi> of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> without any <hi>pause,</hi> is a great <hi>disadvantage</hi> also to the <hi>Speaker himself</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:173675:63"/> as well as an injustice to the <hi>hearer,</hi> for it does not so much as give the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors leisure</hi> to observe the distinction of his <hi>Periods</hi> and the fine Cadences that illustrate the <hi>Speech</hi> with so much <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Ornament.</hi> Not to say, that there's nothing, over and above, so hurtful to the <hi>Lungs,</hi> as to speak with <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>praecipitation,</hi> without any intermission or ever drawing <hi>breath</hi> for't: Insomuch that it has cast many Persons into <hi>deep Consumptions,</hi> and cost some of them their <hi>Lives</hi> too. But when I precaution a Man against <hi>this extreme,</hi> I do not mean that he should throw himself upon the <hi>other;</hi> and when I find fault with him for running <hi>too fast,</hi> I am not presently to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as if I would have him <hi>walk</hi> like a <hi>Sick Man</hi> just come out of a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring Disease, that can hardly <hi>draw his Legs</hi> after him. All I would be at in the matter is <hi>this,</hi> that the <hi>Orator</hi>'s <hi>Tongue</hi> should be agreeable to the <hi>Ears</hi> of his <hi>Auditors;</hi> without either run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>faster</hi> than <hi>they</hi> can follow, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out his words <hi>slower</hi> than they can have the <hi>patience</hi> to attend: <hi>Vini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>'s great failing; of whom <hi>Asellius</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:173675:63"/> said, that he spake always upon the <hi>delay,</hi> by the slowest <hi>snatches, pauses</hi> and <hi>intervals;</hi> and <hi>Geminus Varus,</hi> that he wondered how he managed his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to any credit or account, for he could not speak three words <hi>toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> without <hi>intermission.</hi> There's no manner of pleasure in <hi>hearing</hi> a Man <hi>drawl-out</hi> his words so, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that one might very well bid him, <hi>Speak,</hi> or <hi>hold his Tongue.</hi> His <hi>Speech</hi> must be more <hi>fluent,</hi> before it be good for any thing; but then it ought to <hi>flow</hi> like the <hi>gliding Stream,</hi> and not as a <hi>rapid Torrent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have likewise added that our <hi>Speech</hi> ought to have the grace of <hi>variety,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>medium</hi> of the <hi>Voyce</hi> I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does not consist in an <hi>indivisible point,</hi> but admits of a certain <hi>Latitude</hi> and certain <hi>degrees.</hi> For as to the <hi>highness</hi> or <hi>lowness</hi> of the <hi>Voyce,</hi> there are five or six <hi>Tones</hi> between the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> and the <hi>lowest:</hi> So that the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,</hi> although he avoid both extremes which I condemn, and keep-up to a <hi>discreet measure,</hi> may find room enough yet to <hi>vary</hi> his <hi>Voyce</hi> betwixt the <hi>excess</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:173675:64"/> and the <hi>defect</hi> of it, by turning these five or six <hi>notes</hi> to a just Harmony. As for the <hi>violence</hi> or the <hi>softness</hi> of it, in the next place; his business will be to govern it with such a <hi>moderation;</hi> that although he neither force it to the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extremity</hi> of violence that either hurts <hi>nature</hi> or offends the <hi>Ear,</hi> on the one hand; nor make it languish to the last degree of <hi>softness</hi> or <hi>effeminacy,</hi> and droop into contempt, on the other: he may yet give his <hi>pronunciation</hi> more or less <hi>vehemence</hi> and <hi>mildness,</hi> at dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, as the different circumstances of his Subject or the qualities of his <hi>Speech</hi> shall require. And as to the <hi>swiftness</hi> or <hi>slowness</hi> of it at last, though the <hi>Orator</hi> avoid an extraordinary <hi>dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in <hi>speaking,</hi> on this side, as well as an extravagant <hi>praecipitation</hi> on that, he may never the less speak <hi>faster</hi> or <hi>slower,</hi> upon occasion, according to the best of his judgment; and be as <hi>quick, voluble</hi> and <hi>smart,</hi> more or less, as he pleases, if it do but answer the <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> of his <hi>Discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However let him take this <hi>hint</hi> along with him into the bargain; that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:173675:64"/> he has a mind to <hi>vary</hi> his <hi>Voyce,</hi> upon a turn of Discourse, he must not do it <hi>over hastily,</hi> and with too remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a distinction of <hi>this</hi> from <hi>that;</hi> but with all the <hi>Softness, Courtliness</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> imaginable. I take notice of <hi>this vice</hi> by the <hi>By,</hi> because I have seen many a Great Man run foul upon't; for when they came to <hi>vary</hi> their <hi>Voyce,</hi> they did it so very grosly <hi>all on the sudden,</hi> like a <hi>Thunder-Clap,</hi> and with so palpable a <hi>change,</hi> that it at once surprized and displeased all their <hi>Auditors:</hi> Besides that they who <hi>heard</hi> them out of <hi>sight,</hi> thought it was <hi>some other Person</hi> a speaking to them; the <hi>Voyce</hi> was so <hi>different</hi> and the <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> so <hi>notorious.</hi> But in short, <hi>this vice</hi> is to be avoided for it's fulsom <hi>indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>praecipitation.</hi>

               <p>'TIs not enough for the <hi>Orator</hi> to know that it is his business to <hi>vary</hi> his <hi>Voyce</hi> the best he can, to make his <hi>Speech</hi> the more <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable</hi> to his <hi>Hearers;</hi> nor sufficient neither to practice it in <hi>general</hi> only: But he must have <hi>Particular Rules</hi> also for all the <hi>changes</hi> and <hi>variations</hi> of the <hi>Voyce</hi> that are necessary to set-off his Discourse with a <hi>taking Air</hi> of Elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the quality of the <hi>Subjects</hi> he treats of, the nature of the <hi>Passions</hi> he would shew in <hi>himself</hi> or raise in <hi>others,</hi> the several parts of his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> the different <hi>Figures</hi> he makes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:173675:65"/> use of, and the <hi>variety</hi> of his <hi>words</hi> and his <hi>Phrase.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To begin then with the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Discourse</hi> which the <hi>Orator</hi> may chance to fall upon; there are several sorts of them: As <hi>things natural,</hi> the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil actions</hi> of <hi>men;</hi> the <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py events</hi> of <hi>Life:</hi> And these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of a very <hi>different nature,</hi> ought to be spoken with a quite <hi>different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> and <hi>air.</hi> If you've occasion to speak of <hi>natural things,</hi> with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only to make your <hi>hearers</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand you and no more, there's no need of any great <hi>heat</hi> or <hi>motion</hi> upon the matter; but a <hi>clean</hi> and a <hi>distinct Voyce</hi> will do't; because your business here is not to move the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> so much as to inform the <hi>Ʋnderstanding.</hi> But if your design be to make them admire the <hi>Wonders</hi> of his <hi>Bounty,</hi> of his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and of his <hi>Power</hi> that created them; you must <hi>then</hi> do it with a <hi>Grave Voyce</hi> and a <hi>Tone</hi> of <hi>Admiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If our <hi>Discourse</hi> fall upon the <hi>Actions</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> either <hi>just</hi> and <hi>honest,</hi> that we would have our <hi>Auditors</hi> value
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:173675:66"/> as much as we esteem them our selves, by the way of <hi>Panegyrick</hi> and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>infamous,</hi> that we have a mind to make <hi>them</hi> abhorr as much as we abhorr them <hi>our selves,</hi> by the way of invective or <hi>Philippick:</hi> We must then adjust our <hi>Voyce</hi> to the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the one and the other; expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Honest</hi> with a <hi>full, lofty</hi> and <hi>noble accent,</hi> with a <hi>Tone</hi> of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, honour and esteem; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing upon the <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>infamous,</hi> with a <hi>strong violent</hi> and <hi>Passionate Voyce</hi> as well as with a <hi>Tone</hi> of Anger, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Detestation.</p>
               <p>If it be upon the <hi>events</hi> of <hi>Humane Life,</hi> some are <hi>Fortunate</hi> and others <hi>Ʋnfortunate:</hi> So that the <hi>Orator</hi> must then also <hi>vary</hi> his <hi>Voyce</hi> according to <hi>this difference;</hi> speaking of the <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> as in <hi>Congratulatories,</hi> with a <hi>brisk</hi> and a <hi>Cheerful Air;</hi> and of the <hi>Ʋnfortunate,</hi> on the contrary, as in <hi>Funeral Orations,</hi> with sad and <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Accents:</hi> For <hi>Mirth</hi> best answers the Character of <hi>Good-Fortune;</hi> and <hi>Moan,</hi> the story of <hi>Disappointment</hi> and <hi>Affliction.</hi> The one is the Subject of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173675:66"/> Gaiety and Good humour, and t'other, of Melancholy and Moroseness.</p>
               <p>I have one Observation more yet to make upon all <hi>these Subjects,</hi> and that is this. As for <hi>natural things,</hi> they are not all <hi>alike.</hi> Some are more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than others, for their <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,</hi> their <hi>Beauty</hi> and their <hi>lustre,</hi> as the <hi>Heavens</hi> are far more noble than the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> are far more Illustrious than <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Insects.</hi> And therefore they are not to be <hi>spoken</hi> with the same <hi>Voyce,</hi> nor set forth with an equal Gallantry, State and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of <hi>Pronunciation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Events</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; they are not <hi>all</hi> of the same size and import: And because a <hi>Great Crime</hi> or an <hi>Extraordinary Cruelty</hi> is of worse Consequence than a common <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Peccadillo;</hi> because the interest of Honour and of Life is of <hi>greater concern</hi> than the Interest of Money; the noble exploits of a <hi>Brave Conqueror</hi> than the vulgar Actions of a <hi>Captain of the Mobb,</hi> the safety or the destruction of a <hi>whole

For it would be ridiculous to speak <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Ordinary Things,</hi> that happen every day, with a <hi>Tragical Concern</hi> or a <hi>Tone</hi> of Admiration; and as absurd on the other hand, to speak of <hi>Great Affairs</hi> and matters of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary moment with a <hi>low unconcerned</hi> and <hi>familiar Voyce.</hi>

I'd be satisfied, if I could but be reveng'd of 'em out of hand. I'd hamper 'em sufficiently.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173675:69"/> in the</hi> Street <hi>for the</hi> Scavenger. <hi>I'd pull-out</hi> Aeschines<hi>'s Eyes for him, make him dance upon the</hi> High-Rope <hi>and leap at his own Destruction.

               <p>If the <hi>Orator</hi> be mov'd with a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion</hi> which he would influence upon <hi>others,</hi> he must express himself with a very <hi>soft, submissive</hi> and <hi>Pittiful Voyce.</hi> So when <hi>Cicero</hi> concludes his <hi>Speech</hi> for <hi>Quintius,</hi> in this Manner; <hi>Quintius hath left no stone unturn'd,</hi>
                  <q> Sirs, <hi>he has try'd all the ways and means in the world that are just and honest; but he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet find a</hi> Praetor <hi>that would so much as give him leave to make his demands, nor a Friend of</hi> Nevius <hi>so far as to grant him the Favour of his</hi> Ear <hi>to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. He has often cast himself at their Feet. He has pray'd them over and over by all that 's Sacred and Solemn, either to do him Justice and proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him according to Law; or at least to preserve him his</hi> Honour, <hi>if they did confiscate his</hi> Estate. <hi>He has not deny'd himself to the angryest frowns of his</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>but born his Discountenance with Resignation and Patience. He has kiss'd the hand that threaten'd him the Blow. He has endeavoured to mollifie the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:173675:70"/> of his heart by all that might work upon the inclinations of obstinate Men. He has adjur'd him by the Ashes of his</hi> Brother, <hi>by the dear name of</hi> Father, <hi>by the passionate tenderness of his poor</hi> Wife and Children, <hi>by the Sacred Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their</hi> Affinity <hi>and</hi> Friendship, to take Pity of him; <hi>to have Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his</hi> Age, <hi>if he had no regard to his</hi> Fortune: <hi>If</hi> Quintius <hi>could not move him to Mercy, the name of Man at least was in his good Graces; and Humanity might induce him to condescend to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, where he insisted upon nothing but Honour; quitted all other pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at his Enemy's Discretion, and gave up every thing else but Integrity to his Courtesie. In fine,</hi> Sirs, Quintius <hi>being turn'd out of Doors by his</hi> Kinsman; <hi>rejected by those whom he addressed to with Tears; brow-beaten and terrifi'd by his</hi> Judges: <hi>He has nothing more left now to rely on but your Justice and Humanity,</hi> Aquilius, <hi>for his Good Deliverance. And therefore he throws himself upon your Judgment, and puts his Honour, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, his Life and all into your hands. You are the</hi> Umpire <hi>of his Innocence; you are the Arbitrator of his Fortune, his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:173675:71"/> Hopes and his safety. After so many Tryals and Troubles both of obloquy and scandal, he appeals at last to your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Decision of the matter; not in the quality of an Old Offender, or a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Malefactor; but in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of an Injur'd Wretch, a Miserable Object and an Innocent Person. 'Tis a hard Case,</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>He's cast out of such an Inheritance. 'Tis hard he's over power'd thus with Reproach, Calumny and Contempt, and forc'd to truckle under Wrong and Ignominy. He sees</hi> Another Man <hi>put into Possession of his</hi> Paternal Estate <hi>and his own Right. He has a</hi> Daughter <hi>Ʋnmarried yet to provide for, and can make her no Fortune at all; not a Farthing of a Portion to give her. In a Word, he's oppress'd on all sides by Might and Misfortune; and after all these Grievances, he has done nothing yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Character of an Honest Man. Wherefore he humbly beseeches you,</hi> Sir, <hi>to grant him your Authority to be gone, and begs leave to take that Reputation</hi> away with him, <hi>which he brought</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>after having liv'd a Life of</hi> Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score years <hi>in the Approbation and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of the World, without ever a Blot

                  </q>It is as clear as day now that the <hi>Orator</hi> was oblig'd to <hi>Pronounce those Words</hi> with the <hi>Lowest Voyce</hi> and the <hi>Humblest Accents</hi> of <hi>Submission</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable; as he was <hi>Pleading</hi> before the <hi>Judges,</hi> upon whom the <hi>All,</hi> the <hi>Honour,</hi> the Estate and the Life of <hi>Quintius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. He must needs have turn'd his <hi>Voyce</hi> upon such <hi>Tones</hi> in <hi>Court</hi> as he thought fittest to incline their <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and set <hi>Inclination</hi> it self a Bend. He could not but speak with <hi>Passion</hi> too; but then 'twas a <hi>Passion</hi> of <hi>Tenderness,</hi> a <hi>Passion</hi> of a mind afflicted and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly touch'd with the <hi>misery</hi> and <hi>Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of his <hi>Client,</hi> that he might move the same <hi>Pity</hi> in the Bench: And
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:173675:72"/> there's no doubt but they were <hi>all</hi> touch'd to the quick too, upon the <hi>hearing</hi> of the <hi>motion;</hi> for 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a <hi>Passion</hi> so tenderly represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted should not <hi>melt</hi> the <hi>hearts</hi> of those People before whom it is <hi>Pleaded,</hi> into <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Compassion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpose, the same Author again, <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>First Tusculan Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> says; that, when <hi>these Verses,</hi> out of one of the <hi>Ancient Tragedians,</hi> which represented a young Man Dead, and Unburi'd yet; rowzing-up the <hi>Earth</hi> in the Character of her <hi>Son,</hi> and invoking his <hi>Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Mother, awake! thy careless rest deferr;</l>
                  <l>Think on thy Son, and his poor Bones interr:</l>
                  <l>Before wild Birds, and Beasts, for Prey that roar,</l>
                  <l>My scatter'd Limbs and mangled Corps devour.</l>
               </q>
               <p>When <hi>these Verses,</hi> I say are spoken with a <hi>doleful</hi> and <hi>deplorable Voyce,</hi> they fill the whole <hi>Theatre</hi> with <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Melancholy.</hi> But for the <hi>Speaker</hi> to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:173675:72"/> do <hi>this</hi> well, <hi>there are</hi> several ways of <hi>softening the Voyce</hi> requir'd, according to the <hi>different quality</hi> of the <hi>Words</hi> he makes use of and the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>things he treats of in his Discourse:</hi> However, 'tis far more easie to be <hi>Taught</hi> off the <hi>Lip</hi> in express Language than in <hi>Writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come now to other <hi>Passions</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> and other <hi>variations</hi> or Inflexions of the Voyce and to shew how our <hi>Orator</hi> shall acquit himself in the <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of them to the best advantage. If he would give his <hi>Audience</hi> a Character of some <hi>Brave Hero</hi> and testifie his own <hi>Esteem</hi> of the <hi>Person,</hi> he should do't with a <hi>Lofty</hi> and a <hi>Magnificent Tone,</hi> and his <hi>Voyce</hi> must be as <hi>noble</hi> as his <hi>Strains;</hi> as when <hi>Tully</hi> speaks in his <hi>Oration</hi> for the <hi>Manilian Law,</hi> after this manner: <hi>Now there's none but a</hi> Pompey <hi>in the World, who by his Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Exploits hath out-done the Glory of the</hi> Living <hi>and the Memory of the</hi> Dead; <hi>why do we doubt any longer, and delay giving him the Commission of all our Hopes? For in my Opinion, a</hi> Great Captain <hi>ought to have these Four Eminent Qualities
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:173675:73"/> at Command;</hi> Military Discipline, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Reputation <hi>and</hi> Fortune. <hi>But who was ever yet more knowing in the</hi> Art <hi>of making War than</hi> Pompey? <hi>And who so fit a</hi> General <hi>as</hi> he <hi>that left his Play and his Pastime at</hi> School <hi>in the most Troublesome Times, and went out against the most Powerful Enemies to learn the business of</hi> Arms <hi>in his</hi> Father<hi>'s</hi> Camp, <hi>who was one of the most Famous Warriors of the Age? As</hi> he <hi>that has been train'd up to Arms from his</hi> Cradle; <hi>a</hi> Soldier <hi>and a</hi> Child <hi>at one and the same Time, and and has had the Command of Armies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in his Infancy?</hi> He <hi>that has fought</hi> more Battles <hi>than others have</hi> Duels; <hi>put an end to more Wars than others have</hi> Read, <hi>conquer'd more Provinces than others have attempted only in</hi> Wish? He <hi>that has advanced himself from his Youth-up to the knowledge of Military Discipline by his own Conduct and not by other Men's Wisdom or Council; by Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and not by Misfortunes; whom</hi> Victory <hi>has flush'd to an Illustrious Character, rather than Experience, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or Time? He has not serv'd so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, but he has made more</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests <hi>than</hi> Campagnes. <hi>In short, is there
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:173675:73"/> any danger and difficulty he has not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered; or any Country, where the Fortune of the</hi> Commonwealth <hi>has not exerciced him to the hazard of his Life for't? In</hi> Africa, <hi>beyond the</hi> Alps, <hi>and in</hi> Spain; <hi>against strong Towns and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Kingdoms; in</hi> Civil Wars, <hi>in</hi> Wars <hi>with</hi> Slaves, <hi>in</hi> Servile <hi>and</hi> Sea Fights. <hi>And now, what are so many Wars that have all been waged, carried-on with success and happily concluded by</hi> Pompey, <hi>but so many Tryals of his Skill, his Knowledge and his Virtue? What are so many Enterprizes he has bravely accomplished, and the Battles he has won, but</hi> Heralds <hi>of his Glory and his Valour? What are so many Enemies he has van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished and slain in the Field, but Eternal</hi> Monuments <hi>of his Courage and Conduct?</hi> Let a Man speak <hi>those fine words</hi> with a <hi>Low</hi> and <hi>Languishing Voyce,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can appear more <hi>Cold, Flat,</hi> or <hi>Insipid;</hi> nothing more unworthy, either of the Eloquence of <hi>Cicero,</hi> or of the Honour of <hi>Pompey.</hi> But, on the other hand, let him pronounce them with a <hi>Noble Accent</hi> and animate them with a lofty <hi>Tone</hi> of the <hi>Voyce</hi> answerable to their own <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Magnificence;</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:173675:74"/> and then they will appear in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Lustre,</hi> quicken the <hi>Hearers</hi> with Admiration, and entertain as if they came from the Mouth of <hi>Tully</hi> himself yet, Sixteen Hundred years and more after his Death.</p>
               <p>To pass now from <hi>Admiration</hi> or <hi>Esteem</hi> to the contrary extreme of it. If the <hi>Orator</hi> would shew the <hi>Contempt</hi> he has of a Man, and expose him to his <hi>Auditors,</hi> he must do't with a <hi>Scornful Tone;</hi> but without any <hi>Passion, Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or <hi>Violence</hi> of the <hi>voyce:</hi> As <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> spake to <hi>Coecilius,</hi> who pretended to be preferr'd before <hi>him</hi> for <hi>Pleading</hi> in the Accusation of <hi>Verres.</hi>

               <p>One word more upon this Subject of <hi>varying the voyce</hi> according to the <hi>Passions.</hi> 'Tis plain, when the <hi>Speaker</hi> comes to cool upon a <hi>violent Passion</hi> and to <hi>command</hi> himself after a <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> that he ought to lower the <hi>Tone</hi> of his <hi>voyce</hi> and humble it as <hi>Tully</hi> certainly did in his <hi>Oration</hi> for <hi>Celius,</hi> where he says: <hi>But I must now return to the</hi> Crime; <hi>although the Grief that sensibly afflicts me in speaking of so Great a Man, hath already very much</hi> weakned <hi>my</hi> Faculty <hi>and</hi> Speech, <hi>and almost deprived me of the freedom of Thought.</hi>

               <p>THe several <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Speech</hi> must needs be of a very <hi>different nature;</hi> and so ought the manner of <hi>speaking</hi> to be as <hi>different,</hi> as the <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of each <hi>Part</hi> shall require.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Exordium</hi> ought to be spoken with a <hi>low</hi> and a <hi>modest voyce;</hi> for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>modesty</hi> is not only <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Auditors,</hi> as it is a virtue which shews how great an esteem we have of them, and demonstrates the respect we pay to their presence; but a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <hi>qualification</hi> also for the <hi>Orator,</hi> to manage his <hi>voyce</hi> discreetly and to work it up by degrees of moderation to a higher pitch of warmth and <hi>Passion:</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:173675:79"/> Otherwise, he would put himself out of <hi>breath</hi> at <hi>first start</hi> for want of good conduct, and never be able again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himself genteely at the <hi>full stretch</hi> of his Lungs, to so much <hi>moderation</hi> and <hi>command</hi> of his <hi>voyce</hi> as would give the other <hi>parts</hi> of his <hi>Speech</hi> a greater force than the <hi>Exordium;</hi> where the stress of it lies more, and requires a more <hi>vehement Pronunciation.</hi> However, I do not mean that he should begin so <hi>low</hi> neither, as to be <hi>heard</hi> only by a very few People, just under his nose; but, on the contrary, I would have him <hi>speak-up,</hi> at first, so <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct,</hi> as to be <hi>heard</hi> without <hi>difficulty</hi> or <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> by every Man of his <hi>Auditors</hi> that would give himself the liberty of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending: Let him say what he will else, 'tis no more than a <hi>Wall-Lecture</hi> and a disappointment to his <hi>hearers;</hi> for what signifies the <hi>preamble</hi> of a <hi>Speech,</hi> when they can be never a word the better for't? I have heard a great <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> fail mightily in this Point, and run foul upon that dull vice <hi>in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> He began so <hi>low</hi> at first, that hardly a dozen people of a great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> could hear him; but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>
                  <hi>SEntences</hi> commonly consist of two principal Parts, that are link'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with certain <hi>Particles;</hi> which the <hi>Grammarians</hi> call <hi>Causals, Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Conditionals, Comparatives, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> or <hi>Adversatives:</hi> But they are not <hi>All</hi> of the <hi>same measure</hi> and <hi>length.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For there are <hi>some Sentences</hi> very <hi>short;</hi> each part of which is but a <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expression</hi> and consists only of <hi>one single Proposition;</hi> as these of <hi>Malherbe.</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">He died young, but he died happy. His Friends have not had him long, but his Death is the greatest Trouble and Grief they ever had for the Love and the Loss of him. He has
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:173675:95"/> enjoyed the <hi>Sweets</hi> of the World on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a little while, but he never tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Bitters</hi> on't. He has not taken a <hi>long Walk,</hi> but he went only upon <hi>Flowers.</hi> Whatever Life has of Rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or of Harsh, <hi>Piquant</hi> and Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, was to come in those years which he has not lived to see.</q> Those <hi>Periods</hi> may not only be <hi>pronounced</hi> with <hi>one Breath;</hi> but can hardly be <hi>pronounced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,</hi> without <hi>prejudice</hi> to the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are <hi>some Sentences</hi> again, <hi>lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> as those in the same <hi>Author.</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes"> Look upon the World as a Place where you will be losing something every Day, till you have lost <hi>All</hi> and have no more to lose; and with those Meditations prepossess your dear Soul, that, having its Original from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> it will one Day have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to return <hi>thither.</hi>
                  </q> And those may be <hi>pronounced</hi> all at a <hi>Breath</hi> too, if the <hi>Voice</hi> be naturally <hi>good</hi> for any thing: and however, you ought also to do it as well as you can; for a <hi>Period</hi> so pronounced looks <hi>rounder,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:173675:95"/> with more <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Force,</hi> than it would do upon <hi>several Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's</hi> by fits. For this purpose, you must make it your main Bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> indeed is absolutely necessary in the matter; but <hi>Art</hi> also can do much towards the accomplishing of this end: and we read in the <hi>Bibliotheca</hi> of <hi>Photius,</hi> that <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who had naturally a very <hi>short Breath;</hi> finding that he had need of a very <hi>long one</hi> to speak upon Publick Occasions, gave <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> the <hi>Stage-player,</hi> and a great <hi>Actor</hi> of <hi>Comedy,</hi> a <hi>thousand Drachms</hi> to teach him this <hi>Art;</hi> which he became Master of at last to perfection by the force of Practice and by exercising himself upon all the difficulties of <hi>Respiration.</hi> You must likewise exert your Faculties, as <hi>he</hi> did, and neither spare any time, nor pains, nor cost, to make your self <hi>long-winded</hi> and an <hi>Orator.</hi>

               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:173675:96"/>
               <p>There are other <hi>Periods</hi> that have a longer <hi>Train</hi> yet, and take a larger <hi>Tour</hi> than either of the former; which you cannot <hi>pronounce</hi> without taking your <hi>Breath</hi> once or twice; as this of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> for instance. <q rend="margQuotes">As it is prejudicial to one's Health to take Food and not to digest it, because Crude and Indigested Meats create ill Humours, and do not nourish, but clog and corrupt the Body: So when the Stomach of the <hi>Soul,</hi> that is, the <hi>Memory,</hi> is fill'd with a great deal of Knowledge; if this Knowledge be not well digested by the warmth of <hi>Charity;</hi> if it do not diffuse it self after that through the <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Marrow</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> and pass into the <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of Men; and if it does not become <hi>good</hi> it self upon knowing what is good, and what goes to the making of a good Life; does not <hi>this Knowledge</hi> turn into <hi>Sin,</hi> as <hi>that Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment</hi> does into <hi>bad Humours?</hi>
                  </q> You must pronounce the <hi>first part</hi> of that <hi>Period</hi> without ever taking <hi>Breath</hi> for't; but you cannot pronounce the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:173675:96"/>
                  <hi>second</hi> in the same manner: So that you ought rather to make a <hi>pause</hi> upon't, than force your <hi>Voice</hi> to an Absurdity and run your self quite <hi>out of Breath;</hi> which would be very <hi>ungenteel</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent.</hi> Only you must take care by the Way to <hi>stop</hi> in proper and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Places: that is to say, after <hi>two Points,</hi> a <hi>Colon,</hi> or a <hi>Semi-colon,</hi> or at least after a <hi>Comma;</hi> for to do it otherwise, or <hi>oftner,</hi> would be a thing extremely <hi>disagreeable.</hi> Nothing is more <hi>unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and <hi>uncourtly</hi> than to break off in the <hi>middle</hi> of a Word or an Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

                  </q> In such <hi>Periods</hi> as those, you are upon no force at all to strein your <hi>Lungs;</hi> for you may take your <hi>Breath</hi> as often as you shall have occasion, and make an <hi>equal pause</hi> at every <hi>Article</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; there being no manner of Reason why you should not make a stop upon <hi>one</hi> as well as <hi>another.</hi> So much for what concerns the <hi>Breath</hi> and its <hi>Pauses;</hi> when and where it is to be taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all sorts of <hi>Periods.</hi> As for what remains to be said of it, I think the <hi>Orator</hi> would do well to observe the following Rules.</p>
               <p>You must not distinguish the <hi>parts</hi> of a <hi>Period,</hi> as if there were more <hi>Periods</hi> then one in a Sentence; and yet you must make some Distinction too, that the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:173675:98"/>
                  <hi>Auditor</hi> may more easily discover the <hi>several Clauses</hi> of it one from another: But this is to be done especially, when the <hi>Period</hi> is <hi>longer</hi> than ordinary; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the <hi>Mind</hi> and the <hi>Memory</hi> of those that hear you, and perhaps your own faculties too, would be <hi>confounded:</hi> and the <hi>Period,</hi> tho' never so well turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would perplex the <hi>Pronunciation</hi> and appear embarassed by the <hi>length</hi> of it. However when there are several <hi>Clauses</hi> in a <hi>Sentence,</hi> and every one of them requires a peculiar distinction for some reason or other, you would do well to distinguish them by the <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> but without taking your <hi>Breath</hi> for all that; except there be so many of 'em, that one single <hi>Respiration</hi> cannot serve all their Turns, nor reach the end of the whole <hi>Period. Cicero</hi> without doubt observed that upon this <hi>Period</hi> of his <hi>Oration</hi> for the <hi>Manilian Law.</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">What a shameful thing 'tis, Sirs, that he who Massacred such a vast Number of our <hi>Citizens</hi> in one Day throughout all <hi>Asia,</hi> in so many <hi>Cities</hi> there, at a <hi>Word's</hi> Warning and upon one single <hi>Dispatch;</hi> has not only not condign'd

               <p>'Tis proper to make a <hi>pause</hi> upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Period,</hi> but it must be a very <hi>short</hi> one upon <hi>short</hi> ones, and a little <hi>longer</hi> upon <hi>long</hi> ones: For, over and above that it very much conduces to the better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing of <hi>Periods</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and does not a little assist the <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> and the <hi>Memory</hi> of the <hi>Hearer;</hi> it is almost incredible how it also <hi>reinforces</hi> the <hi>Lungs,</hi> the <hi>Breast</hi> and the <hi>Arteries</hi> of the <hi>Speaker:</hi> And if you do but practice this <hi>Rule</hi> you will find the benefit and advantage of it by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. I would advise you also to take care to begin the <hi>following Period</hi> always a degree <hi>lower</hi> than you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:173675:99"/> the <hi>first;</hi> which will both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the <hi>variation</hi> of your <hi>Voice</hi> and to the <hi>reinforcement</hi> of your <hi>Organs.</hi> Sometimes on the contrary, 'tis better to begin it with a <hi>Tone</hi> a little <hi>higher</hi> than the <hi>Cadence</hi> of the <hi>last,</hi> according as the <hi>Orator</hi> shall best judge of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the necessity of the <hi>Subject:</hi> which will serve also to <hi>vary</hi> even the <hi>variation of the Voice</hi> it self; for you must not do't always on the <hi>same fashion</hi> or in the <hi>same Key.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's another Observation yet which I have to make here. 'Tis this. When you have a <hi>Period</hi> to Pronounce that requires a great <hi>contention</hi> or <hi>eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Voice,</hi> you must moderate and manage your <hi>Voice</hi> with good Conduct upon <hi>those Periods</hi> that precede it; lest by employing the whole <hi>force</hi> of it upon <hi>those,</hi> you be spent and constrained at last to pronounce <hi>this languidly,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more of <hi>vigour, vehemency</hi> and <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> 'Tis this Government that <hi>Roscius</hi> and <hi>Esopus,</hi> two of the famousest <hi>Actors</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> ever had, very well observed; as <hi>Tully</hi> takes notice in his <hi>third Book of

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:173675:102"/> august, majestick, adorable,</hi> are terms of <hi>Honour</hi> that must be pronounced with a <hi>magnificent Tone:</hi> or to <hi>dispraise</hi> and <hi>detest;</hi> as <hi>cruel, heinous, wicked, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable, abominable, execrable, monstrous,</hi> which are all to be pronounced with a most <hi>Passionate</hi> and <hi>loud Voyce:</hi> or, to <hi>complain</hi> and <hi>lament;</hi> as, <hi>unfortunate, miserable, fatal, mournful, pitiful, deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, lamentable,</hi> are all <hi>sorrowful Words</hi> and require a <hi>melancholy Accent.</hi> He must also <hi>lay</hi> more stress upon <hi>Words of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;</hi> as, <hi>grand, high, sublime, profound, long, large, innumerable, eternal;</hi> as well as upon <hi>Words of Ʋniversality;</hi> as <hi>all the World, generally, every where, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, never:</hi> Here the <hi>Pronunciation</hi> must be pois'd to a certain <hi>gravity</hi> and <hi>height</hi> of <hi>Accent.</hi> As for those terms of <hi>extenuation</hi> and <hi>slight;</hi> as, <hi>pittiful, insignificant, little, low, mean, despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, feeble,</hi> he must pronounce 'em with a very <hi>low, lessening, abject Voyce,</hi> and an <hi>Accent</hi> of the greatest <hi>scorn</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</hi> For the purpose: If a <hi>Divine</hi> a <hi>Preaching,</hi> should bring-in a Soul la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under the sense of many great Infirmities, and saying: <hi>When I search'd into the Faith of my Heart, I found it so
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:173675:103"/> weak, so imperfect, so languishing,</hi> &amp;c. To speak that Resentment with an <hi>elevated Tone</hi> or any <hi>great Contention</hi> of the <hi>Voyce,</hi> would be a <hi>ridiculous Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> and contrary to the very <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of things, as well as the <hi>Rules</hi> of Sence, Reason and Reflection. For those Words of <hi>weak, imperfect, languishing,</hi> require a <hi>doleful Accent,</hi> an <hi>Accent</hi> of <hi>Moan,</hi> and a <hi>low</hi> as well as a <hi>slow Voyce.</hi> This Distinction of the <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> besides that it is more <hi>agreeable</hi> to the things signified by such Words, will serve over and above for the <hi>variation of the Voyce,</hi> which the <hi>Orator</hi> must always make it his Business to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
               <p>To <hi>conclude</hi> this <hi>Discourse:</hi> I shall add, that you must keep-up your <hi>Voyce</hi> still to an <hi>audible height</hi> upon the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation</hi> of the <hi>last Words</hi> of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod;</hi> so that they may be as <hi>well,</hi> not to say better <hi>heard</hi> than the <hi>rest:</hi> But this is to be done chiefly, when those final Words are composed of <hi>Syllables</hi> that make but a <hi>weak</hi> and a <hi>dull Sound</hi> of <hi>themselves.</hi> For if your <hi>Period</hi> were to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:173675:103"/> conclude with these Words, <hi>une splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur éclatante et incomparable;</hi> though you should not raise your <hi>Voyce</hi> upon 'em, nor make 'em <hi>ring</hi> half so <hi>loud a peal</hi> as you might in the <hi>Ears</hi> of your <hi>Auditors,</hi> they would not fail yet of being <hi>heard</hi> well enough for all that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>strong Sound</hi> which the <hi>Letters a</hi> and <hi>o</hi> make of <hi>themselves</hi> in that expression. But if your <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> were to end with these Words, <hi>Ce n'est q'une figure, une type, &amp; une si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude;</hi> and you should pronounce 'em <hi>faintly,</hi> they would <hi>die</hi> in your own <hi>Mouth</hi> and never reach the <hi>Ear</hi> of your nearest <hi>Auditor</hi> under your Nose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Letters e, i,</hi> and <hi>u</hi> have so <hi>little</hi> of <hi>Sound</hi> in <hi>themselves,</hi> and appear very <hi>low</hi> and <hi>flat</hi> off the <hi>Lip.</hi> This <hi>Praecept</hi> upon the <hi>Pronunciation</hi> of the <hi>last Words</hi> of <hi>Sentences</hi> ought to be as much taken notice of and practic'd as any other; for most of our <hi>Publick O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators</hi> now a days commonly fail in this Point.</p>

               <p>'TIS <hi>Time</hi> now to come to <hi>Gesture,</hi> which is of no little importance and advantage to a Man that <hi>speaks in Publick;</hi> for it qualifies the <hi>Orator</hi> to convey the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and the <hi>Passions</hi> of his Mind to his <hi>Auditors</hi> with greater force and delight; their Senses being far more effectually wrought upon by <hi>Pronunciation</hi> and <hi>Gesture TOGETHER,</hi> than by <hi>Pronunciation ALONE.</hi> For this reason, when a Man is <hi>Hearing</hi> a <hi>Sermon,</hi> he desires mightily to see the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Preacher;</hi> and if his <hi>Pew</hi> deprive him of that Happiness, he goes Home with less Satisfaction, let it be never so <hi>well spoken.</hi> However, these <hi>two things</hi> are not less important, the <hi>one</hi> than the <hi>other;</hi> and as <hi>both faculties</hi> joyn'd together express a <hi>Thought</hi> to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:173675:104"/> perfection, so either of them apart do not fail of expressing it as <hi>well</hi> too, though with <hi>less Power</hi> and <hi>Vigour.</hi> For if it is by <hi>Speech</hi> alone we converse with the <hi>Blind,</hi> 'tis by <hi>Gesture</hi> alone that we can converse also with the <hi>Deaf;</hi> and without this Faculty, we should have no Commerce or Conversation at all with 'em. Besides <hi>Gesture</hi> has this advantage above <hi>Pronunciation;</hi> that, by <hi>Speech</hi> we are only understood by People of our <hi>own Country</hi> and <hi>Lingua;</hi> but by <hi>Gesture,</hi> we render our <hi>Thoughts</hi> and our <hi>Passions</hi> intelligible to <hi>all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> indifferently, under the Sun. 'Tis as it were the <hi>common Language</hi> of all Mankind, which strikes the <hi>Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> in at our <hi>Eyes</hi> as much as <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> does in at our <hi>Ears.</hi> And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things of <hi>Movement</hi> and <hi>Action</hi> should touch us so sensibly; since <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> which has nothing of it, penetrates so far into our <hi>Affections,</hi> and imprints so strongly, that it sometimes surpasses the very <hi>force</hi> of <hi>Words.</hi> Speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone does the main Work in the Minds of those that understand it; but when it is destitute of <hi>Gesture,</hi> which is the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:173675:105"/>
                  <hi>Life</hi> of all <hi>Speech,</hi> (as <hi>Asconius</hi> says) it makes but a <hi>Dispassionate</hi> and a <hi>Dead Discourse.</hi> For this reason, <hi>Pliny Junior</hi> mentioning the <hi>Recitations</hi> which People in his Days made of <hi>their Orations</hi> and <hi>Poems</hi> to their Friends, either in reading 'em <hi>themselves</hi> or in having them read by <hi>others;</hi> says, that this <hi>Reading</hi> of them was a mighty disadvantage to their <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence</hi> and <hi>Character,</hi> because the main helps of <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> the <hi>Eyes</hi> and the <hi>Hands</hi> were hinder'd by't; and that it was no wonder if the <hi>Attention</hi> of their <hi>Auditors</hi> droop'd upon it. But on the contrary, when the <hi>Discourse</hi> is help'd-on and enforced, not only with a <hi>Pronunciation</hi> suitable to the <hi>Subject,</hi> but with an <hi>agreeable</hi> and <hi>powerful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> it appears truly animated to a wonderful degree of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Vigour:</hi> For then the <hi>Orator</hi> holds his <hi>Auditor</hi> (as it were) by the <hi>Eyes</hi> as well as by the <hi>Ears</hi> and absolutely engages both his <hi>Attention</hi> and his <hi>Reason</hi> at once: And if he speaks <hi>thus</hi> to an <hi>Adversary</hi> not so well qualified, he dashes him out of Countenance, he confounds him with <hi>fear,</hi> and overcomes him with <hi>shame. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:173675:105"/> discountenanced <hi>Cecilius</hi> with this Reflexion, when he would have Pleaded against <hi>Hortensius</hi> in the Accusation of <hi>Verres,</hi> and his Ambition carried him beyond his Capacity: <hi>Consider on't</hi> (said he to him) <hi>and weigh the thing well; for in my Opinion you are in great Danger, not only to be baffled by his</hi> Words <hi>and his</hi> Pronunciation, <hi>but to have your</hi> Eyes <hi>dazzled too by his</hi> Gesture <hi>and the</hi> Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>of his</hi> Body; <hi>lest he should disorder all your Thoughts, amuse you and make you forget whatever you had to say.</hi> And when <hi>Cicero</hi> again represents the matter in his <hi>Books of the Orator,</hi> how <hi>Crassus</hi> baffled and fool'd <hi>Brutus</hi> once at the <hi>Barr,</hi> when he was a pleading against him; he says, that he pronounced his Words after such a manner that they put him quite out of Countenance; with an <hi>Eye</hi> so stedfastly fix'd upon him; making-up all his <hi>Gesture</hi> against him, and confronting him at every <hi>turn,</hi> as if he would have swallowed him up at a <hi>Look,</hi> or in a <hi>Breath.</hi> But that this <hi>silent Language</hi> of your <hi>Face</hi> and your <hi>Hands</hi> may be well understood and move the Affections of those that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:173675:106"/>
                  <hi>see</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> you; it must be well adjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Thing</hi> you speak of as well as agreeable to your <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Design:</hi> besides that it is always to resemble the <hi>Passion</hi> you have a Mind either to <hi>express</hi> or to <hi>excite.</hi> For if you should speak of <hi>sad things</hi> with a <hi>brisk Look</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>sorrow</hi> with a <hi>gay Countenance;</hi> or if you should <hi>affirm</hi> any thing with the <hi>Gesture</hi> of a Man that were <hi>denying</hi> it, 'twould take away all <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> from your <hi>Words:</hi> No Body would believe or admire you. You must also have a care there be nothing <hi>affected</hi> in your <hi>Gesture;</hi> for, generally speaking, <hi>all Affectation</hi> is <hi>odious:</hi> but it must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear purely <hi>Natural,</hi> as the very <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Result</hi> both of the <hi>things</hi> you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and of the <hi>Affection</hi> that moves you to <hi>speak</hi> them. In fine, the <hi>Orator</hi> must manage his <hi>Gesture</hi> so nicely, that there may be nothing, if possible, in all the <hi>Dispositions</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> which may offend the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the <hi>Spectators;</hi> as well as take care that his <hi>Pronunciation</hi> have nothing in it, which may grate and disoblige the <hi>Ears</hi> of the <hi>Hearers:</hi> Otherwise, his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:173675:106"/> will be <hi>less agreeable</hi> to his <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and his <hi>Speech</hi> it self will not have all that <hi>Grace, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> which it ought to have.</p>
               <p>But the Business of <hi>Gesture</hi> is far more difficult to observe than that of <hi>Pronunciation;</hi> for a <hi>Man</hi> may <hi>hear</hi> his <hi>own Voyce</hi> well enough when he cannot <hi>see</hi> his Face at all: and as for the other <hi>Parts</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> he can but see <hi>them</hi> imperfectly, how they move and keep-up to the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>good Action.</hi> This made <hi>Demosthenes</hi> betake himself to speak his <hi>Harangues</hi> and his <hi>Pleadings</hi> before a <hi>great Looking-Glass,</hi> that he might observe his <hi>Gestures</hi> the better, and be able to distinguish betwixt <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>wrong, decent</hi> and <hi>indecent Actions.</hi> This method, I think, might be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd to purpose. There's only this disadvantage in the <hi>Glass,</hi> that it always represents on the <hi>left</hi> what is on the <hi>right,</hi> and on the <hi>right</hi> what's on the <hi>left;</hi> so that when you make a <hi>motion</hi> with the <hi>right Hand,</hi> you have the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion</hi> of it as if it were made with the <hi>left;</hi> which confounds the <hi>Gesture</hi> and appears a little untoward: So that if
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:173675:107"/> to <hi>adjust</hi> your self to the <hi>Glass,</hi> you make a motion with the <hi>left,</hi> 'tis true, it reflects the <hi>Gestu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e</hi> as if it were made with the <hi>right;</hi> but then you may chance to get an <hi>ill Habit</hi> by so doing, which of all <hi>things</hi> you ought to avoid. However, this inconvenience is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly made up to you in the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it gives you of <hi>seeing</hi> not only your <hi>Face</hi> in all its <hi>Countenances,</hi> but the <hi>state</hi> of your <hi>whole Body</hi> too in all its <hi>Postures</hi> and <hi>Motions:</hi> so that you may easily discover by it any thing that is <hi>unhandsome</hi> and <hi>disagreeable,</hi> either in your <hi>Habit</hi> or your <hi>Gesture;</hi> and any <hi>Action</hi> again, on the contrary, that adds <hi>grace</hi> to your <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>force</hi> to your <hi>Discourse.</hi> But for want of a <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glass,</hi> you should get some of your <hi>Friends</hi> to do you this good Office; <hi>such an one,</hi> I mean, as is capable of judging whether your <hi>Gesture</hi> be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> upon Tryal and frequent Practice.

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Particular Rules <hi>for</hi> Gesture.</head>
               <p>TO give the World some <hi>particular Rules</hi> of <hi>Gesture,</hi> I shall in the <hi>first place</hi> speak of the <hi>Government,</hi> the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Ballance</hi> that the whole <hi>Body</hi> ought to be kept-up to; and in the <hi>next,</hi> how the <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>Eyes,</hi> the <hi>Eye-brows</hi> and all the <hi>Face</hi> must be mov'd and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd; and at last I shall come to the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Hands;</hi> of which there is more to be said, then of all the <hi>other Parts</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> put together.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>whole Body,</hi> it ought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>change</hi> Place nor Posture every moment. This <hi>fickle Agitation</hi> would be as <hi>indecent</hi> as the <hi>Gesture</hi> of <hi>Curion,</hi> whom <hi>Junius</hi> compared to a Man at Sea in a <hi>Cock-boat,</hi> for tossing his Body about continually, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:173675:108"/> to the <hi>right</hi> and sometimes to the <hi>left,</hi> with the greatest <hi>inconstancy</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: But then, on the other hand, it must neither <hi>stand</hi> like a <hi>Stock,</hi> nor be as immoveable as a <hi>May-pole;</hi> for over and above that this is not <hi>Natural; God Almighty</hi> having made the <hi>Body</hi> of such a <hi>moveable Meen</hi> and of such <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> as dispose it for <hi>Motion,</hi> that it ought to <hi>move</hi> sometimes, either as the <hi>Soul</hi> directs or as the <hi>Body</hi> it self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; It is also <hi>disagreeable</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteel</hi> for want of <hi>Variety;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes it so well upon every occasion or change of Discourse, and sets every thing-off to admiration.</p>

Upon this, he <hi>acts a Tragedy</hi> of <hi>Accius,</hi> on a Publick Occasion, which contained the <hi>fine Verses</hi> upon <hi>Telamon</hi>'s <hi>Exile,</hi> and the horrible Calamities of <hi>Priam</hi> and his Family, which are relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Tusculan Questions</hi> and in his <hi>Oration</hi> for <hi>Sextius:</hi> But in <hi>those Verses</hi> you must think, his <hi>Imagination</hi> was not half so much struck with the <hi>false Misfortunes</hi> of the Persons in the <hi>old Fable,</hi> as with the <hi>Miseries</hi> that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:173675:113"/> were too <hi>true</hi> and the <hi>real sufferings</hi> of his <hi>Friend.</hi> Insomuch that the <hi>Acting</hi> of them transported him to so great a <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi> that he spake them upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> not only with a very mournful <hi>Voyce,</hi> but with <hi>Eyes</hi> also <hi>bath'd in Tears,</hi> which set all <hi>indifferent Persons</hi> that were present there a-weeping bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and even made his <hi>Enemies</hi> blush with Tears in their Eyes at his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this went a great way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the melting of the Hearts of People and the reconciling of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; towards the bringing of him <hi>Home</hi> again and the <hi>reinstating</hi> of him in his former Dignity, Reputation and Character; as <hi>Cicero</hi> himself tells us with the <hi>thankfullest Acknowledgments</hi> of the <hi>good Office,</hi> which that famous <hi>Actor,</hi> his Great and his Cordial Friend, had done him upon this occasion.</p>
               <p>Now if <hi>this Tenderness</hi> of the <hi>Eyes</hi> or the faculty of weeping at discretion, be of such influence and advantage in the <hi>Theatre,</hi> where People go only for <hi>Diversion</hi> and <hi>Spectacle;</hi> how much more in the <hi>Church</hi> then, where the <hi>Glory

Which he told their <hi>Pastors</hi> of, in words to this Effect, as you'll find in the <hi>Acts of the Holy Apostles: Remember that for the space of three years, I have not ceased to warn every one of you night and day with my Tears: Remember the many Exhortations I have made you, and the many Tears I have shed for you.</hi> The <hi>Orator</hi> therefore ought first of all to form in himself a <hi>strong Idea</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> of his <hi>Passion;</hi> and the <hi>Passion</hi> it self will then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow in course; ferment imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into the <hi>Eyes,</hi> and affect both the <hi>Sense</hi> and the <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> of his <hi>Spectators</hi> with the <hi>same Tenderness.

Others</hi> again <hi>lean</hi> the <hi>Elbow</hi> upon the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and make what <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures</hi> they think fit with the <hi>Hand,</hi> rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner, and raised upon the <hi>Elbow;</hi> which is neither <hi>commendable</hi> nor <hi>decent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Hands</hi> now, they are the chief Instruments of <hi>Action,</hi> and they can <hi>vary</hi> it as many ways too as there are <hi>Things,</hi> which they are capable of signifying. For we make use of them in <hi>Accusing, Acquitting, Promising, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, Intreating, Admiring</hi> or <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and in <hi>representing</hi> almost all the things we <hi>speak</hi> of in the World; which require so many different <hi>Actions</hi> of the <hi>Hands:</hi> So that <hi>Quintilian</hi> says very well, the other Parts of the <hi>Body</hi> help
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:173675:116"/> him mightily that <hi>speaks;</hi> but the <hi>Hands,</hi> as it were, <hi>speak</hi> themselves. And <hi>Martial,</hi> instead of saying <hi>Tout le Geste,</hi> every Gesture, says <hi>Toute le Main,</hi> every Hand; as if <hi>Gesture</hi> were nothing else but the <hi>Movement</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the <hi>Hands.</hi> But the main thing however is to <hi>move</hi> them <hi>well,</hi> and with a <hi>good Grace.</hi> These following <hi>Rules</hi> will be of some service to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> You must make use of no <hi>Action</hi> at all in the beginning of a Discourse, or at least shew no considerable <hi>Gesture,</hi> as soon as ever your <hi>Mouth</hi> is open; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be upon an <hi>Exordium, EXAB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RƲPTO,</hi> as they call it; <hi>An Abrupt starting of a Discourse,</hi> as in that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue</hi> of <hi>Ajax</hi> against <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> upon the Subject of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s <hi>Armour.</hi>

                     <hi>Sigaeum,</hi> and the <hi>Navy</hi> which there lay:</l>

                  <l>Then holding up his <hi>Hands, O Jove!</hi> he said;</l>
                  <l>Before the Fleet must <hi>We</hi> our Title plead?</l>

               </q>
               <p>This extension of the <hi>Hands</hi> there, toward the <hi>Port,</hi> was without doubt very <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>pertinent</hi> as well as <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:</hi> but it had been a <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent stretch,</hi> without such an <hi>abrupt Exclamation.</hi> For, as we said before upon the Subject of <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Exordium's</hi> ought to be spoken <hi>mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and without any <hi>Motion.</hi> 2dly, You must never <hi>clap</hi> your <hi>Hands,</hi> nor <hi>thump</hi> the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> nor <hi>beat</hi> your <hi>Breast;</hi> for that smells of the <hi>Juggler</hi> and the <hi>Mountebank,</hi> and 'tis good for nothing. 3dly, You must make all your <hi>Gestures</hi> with the <hi>right Hand;</hi> and if you ever use the <hi>left,</hi> let it only be to accompany the <hi>other,</hi> and never lift it up so <hi>high</hi> as
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:173675:117"/> the <hi>right.</hi> But to use an <hi>Action</hi> with the <hi>left Hand</hi> alone, is a thing you must avoid for its <hi>indecency.</hi> The only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to this <hi>Rule</hi> will be in Places, where you speak of the <hi>right Hand</hi> and the <hi>left</hi> by <hi>Name;</hi> as if you chance to discourse of the <hi>seperation,</hi> which the <hi>Sovereign Judge</hi> of the World will make between the <hi>good</hi> and the <hi>bad</hi> in the last Day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> placing the <hi>Just</hi> on his <hi>right Hand</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi> on his <hi>left:</hi> There 'tis not only allowable, but necessary to adjust your <hi>Gestures</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Distinction;</hi> making <hi>one</hi> of them with the <hi>right Hand</hi> alone, and the <hi>other</hi> with the <hi>left</hi> alone. And so when <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> commands the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant to cut-off his <hi>right Hand,</hi> if it offend him; I would represent that <hi>Action,</hi> if 'twere my Business, with the <hi>Gesture</hi> of the <hi>left,</hi> because there's no other to do't; for the <hi>right Hand</hi> cannot cut-off <hi>it self.</hi> 4thly, The <hi>right Hand</hi> applies it self very pertinently to the <hi>Breast,</hi> when the <hi>Orator</hi> speaks of <hi>himself,</hi> and declares his own <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Passions;</hi> his <hi>Heart,</hi> his <hi>Soul,</hi> or his <hi>Conscience:</hi> I say barely, <hi>applies</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:173675:118"/> it self; for it must be done only by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Hand gently</hi> upon it, and not by <hi>beating</hi> on't, as some People do. You must every where avoid making use of the <hi>left Hand</hi> alone. But there are some Men naturally <hi>left-Handed,</hi> and 'tis impossible for <hi>them</hi> to forbear using the <hi>left Hand</hi> sometimes, because they have been <hi>accustomed</hi> to it from their <hi>Infancy.</hi> In this case, I cannot advise 'em better, towards the covering of the Imperfection, if they cannot break off the Habit, than to make all their <hi>Action</hi> with <hi>both Hands</hi> together; for then they'll not offend the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the <hi>Spectators</hi> with the <hi>left Hand</hi> alone; which can make no <hi>motion</hi> of <hi>it self,</hi> but what is <hi>unhandsome</hi> and <hi>disagreeable.</hi> 5thly, Your <hi>Gesture</hi> must pass from the <hi>left</hi> to the <hi>right,</hi> and end at the <hi>right</hi> too; not as it were in <hi>striking</hi> with the the Hand, upon a <hi>stretch</hi> of Violence; but in laying of it handsomely down with <hi>Gentleness</hi> and <hi>Moderation.</hi> 6thly, You must begin your Action with your <hi>Speech,</hi> and end it with it again; for it would be ridiculous either to begin your <hi>Gestures,</hi> before you had opened your
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:173675:118"/>
                  <hi>Mouth,</hi> or to continue them after you had done <hi>Speaking.</hi> 7thly, The <hi>Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of your <hi>Hands</hi> must always answer the Nature of the things you speak of; For to say, <hi>Attirer</hi> to come in, <hi>stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-out the Hand; Repousser</hi> to go back, <hi>pulling your Hand at you; Separer</hi> to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, <hi>joyning your Hands together; Joyndre</hi> to joyn, <hi>separating them; Serrer</hi> to close, <hi>opening them; Ouvrir</hi> to open, <hi>closing them; Hausser</hi> to raise, <hi>hanging them down; Baisser</hi> to cast down, <hi>hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up;</hi> would be against the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of things and against <hi>Reason,</hi> and would expose you to the Laughter and Derision of your <hi>Hearers.</hi> 8thly, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all great Great <hi>Motions,</hi> the Action of the <hi>Hands</hi> is particularly <hi>necessary,</hi> to answer the Heat and Passion of the <hi>Figures</hi> that are made use of in a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi> For Example, in this <hi>Apostrophe</hi> which a <hi>famous Lawyer</hi> made when he was <hi>Pleading</hi> to the <hi>Princes of the Blood of</hi> France: <hi>You Noble and Generous Princes, Children of such a Father! how comes it that you do not strangle those</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors <hi>with your</hi> own Hands, <hi>who would fix upon your Foreheads the most Ʋgly and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:173675:119"/> Infamous Blot that can be imagin'd in the World?</hi> And who does not see here what <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Hands</hi> ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Pronunciation of these Words, <hi>that you do not strangle with your own Hands,</hi> to give the <hi>Figure</hi> all the force, vigour and efficacy that it ought to have? 9thly, If you lift-up the <hi>Hand,</hi> it ought not to be higher than the <hi>Eyes,</hi> and but very little <hi>lower:</hi> Whereas there are some that <hi>raise</hi> it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly up to the <hi>Sky,</hi> as if they threatened the <hi>Stars.</hi> The same <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> ought to be observed in <hi>holding the Hand down;</hi> and you must have a care also of doing as some People do, when they are <hi>Preaching</hi> in a <hi>Pulpit;</hi> who hang down their <hi>right Hand</hi> now and then as if it were <hi>Dead;</hi> which is extremely <hi>disagreeable</hi> to the <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>dispassionate</hi> to the <hi>Fancy.</hi> 10thly, In fine, your <hi>Eyes</hi> must always have your <hi>Hands</hi> within view: They must always be within compass of your <hi>Head,</hi> and lash-out as little as possible, either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or under, higher or lower than the <hi>Eyes:</hi> So that they whom you <hi>speak</hi> to upon an Address, may see your <hi>Mouth,</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:173675:119"/> your <hi>Eyes</hi> and your <hi>Hands</hi> concurring <hi>all</hi> together, every one in its own way, to signifie the same thing; which will make a deeper and more agreeable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression both upon their Senses and their Understandings. 11thly, You ought not to <hi>stretch-out</hi> your <hi>Arms,</hi> side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, farther than half a Foot at most from the Trunk of your Body: Or, else you will throw-your <hi>Gesture</hi> quite out of sight, unless you turn your <hi>Head</hi> aside to see it; which would be very <hi>ridiculous.</hi> 12thly, You must raise your <hi>Hand</hi> in <hi>Swearing;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> himself, when he speaks to Men with an <hi>Oath,</hi> whether in his Promises or his Menaces, says in several Places of his <hi>Speech,</hi> that he <hi>lifts up his Hand:</hi> That is to say; <hi>he Swears,</hi> that he will either bless them in his Mercy or punish them in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The same thing is to be done upon an <hi>Exclamation;</hi> so that the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi> may answer the <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> and both of 'em may be adjusted to the <hi>Nature of the Thing.</hi> 13thly, You must not make use of <hi>Action</hi> every where. For as the <hi>Hands</hi> ought not to be <hi>idle,</hi> on one side; so 'tis impertinent on the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:173675:120"/> other, to keep them in <hi>perpetual motion.</hi> This would run you foul upon that <hi>vice</hi> which the <hi>Antients</hi> have call'd <hi>the bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Hands:</hi> And it would be below the Gravity, Character and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an <hi>Orator,</hi> to turn <hi>Mimick</hi> in an <hi>Audience,</hi> or to do as those old <hi>PANTOMIMES</hi> of the <hi>Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> did, who signified every thing by their <hi>Antick Gesti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Apish Gestures</hi> without ever speaking a Word. 14thly, There are some <hi>Actions</hi> which you must never attempt to represent with your <hi>Hands,</hi> nor put your self in the <hi>Posture</hi> of those that make use of 'em; as of <hi>Fencing,</hi> of <hi>bending a Bow,</hi> of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting a Musquet,</hi> of <hi>playing upon an Instrument of Musick,</hi> as if you had the <hi>Spinette</hi> or <hi>Virginals</hi> under your Fingers, or a Harp in your Hands. 15thly, You must take great care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void imitating those <hi>Actions</hi> which are <hi>Base, Filthy</hi> and <hi>Dishonest,</hi> by any <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi> of the <hi>Hands</hi> or <hi>Movement</hi> of the <hi>Body;</hi> as in making a Description of the <hi>Debaucheries</hi> and <hi>Impurities</hi> of a <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> a <hi>Verres,</hi> or any other
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:173675:120"/>
                  <hi>lewd Person.</hi> 16thly, As for other <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which you can represent with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and good Manners, your <hi>Gesture</hi> ought to be very moderate and modest; not bold, vast and extensive, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed too frequent neither, which would make such a violent Agitation of the <hi>Arms</hi> and the <hi>Hands</hi> as would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <hi>Orator,</hi> and as if he were <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing away Flies.</hi> This was <hi>Curion</hi>'s fault, who being mightily agitated once in his Discourse, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> relates, with his <hi>Collegue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

You can never sufficiently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Obligation you lay under to your</hi> Collegue Curion; <hi>for if he had not been here, the</hi> Flies <hi>would have eaten you up now upon the spot.</hi> 17thly, When you make use of a <hi>Prosopopoeia,</hi> and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is brought in a speaking, you must take care of making use of any <hi>Gestures</hi> that would not be proper for <hi>Him</hi> to use, and agreeable to the State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which you represent <hi>Him</hi> a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:173675:121"/> speaking: as if you were to represent <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> with his <hi>Hands</hi> nail'd to't, a-crying; <hi>My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> or, <hi>Father! forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> You must not clap your <hi>Hands</hi> together upon the Exclamation, nor lift them up towards Heaven: Or, in reciting those words which he spake to his blessed Mother at that time, <hi>Woman! behold thy Son;</hi> you are not to make him <hi>pronounce</hi> them, as if he <hi>pointed</hi> at St. <hi>John</hi> with his <hi>Finger.</hi> One would think that common Sense might teach every Man this Faculty well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, without ever having an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to be told on't, or advis'd about it. But I thought 'twould not be labour lost however, to say something of it, because you are so apt, I know, in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>praying to God,</hi> to clap your Hands together: or, in <hi>shewing a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> to point at him with your Finger: And there was some danger lest you might have done it also upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion as well as another, without ever thinking how <hi>improper</hi> it is, if you had not been expressly praecautioned against
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:173675:121"/> it here by the <hi>posture</hi> of the <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Hand;</hi> and whether it be convenient or proper to reckon the several Members of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi> upon the <hi>Fingers,</hi> all Men are not of the same opinion. It was an <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> very familiar to <hi>Hortensius,</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> seems to rally it in some Places. For my own part, as I do not think it very necessary on the <hi>one</hi> Hand, so I find nothing discommendable or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in it on the <hi>other.</hi> I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here of that <hi>Gesture</hi> of the <hi>Hands,</hi> which was so common among the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi> upon a great Affliction or Grief; as, <hi>beating</hi> sometimes the <hi>Head,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Brow,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Breast,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Thigh,</hi> because 'tis a thing quite out of Use and Fashion in this Age. I do not touch upon <hi>those Praecepts</hi> neither, which they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced upon the <hi>Motions of the Feet,</hi> and the <hi>Knees,</hi> or about the <hi>Orator's Gate;</hi> because they <hi>harangu'd</hi> then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Tribune,</hi> a Place built on purpose for making their <hi>Speeches</hi> upon; where
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:173675:122"/> there was room enough to walk up and down several Paces, as they often did: Insomuch that <hi>Flavius Virginius</hi> ask'd a <hi>Declamer</hi> once in a Banter, whom he went to hear, and who had <hi>walk'd</hi> much in his Discourse, <hi>how many Miles he had Declam'd?</hi> But the <hi>Speaker</hi> at this day, whether in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> or at the <hi>Barr,</hi> stands still in the <hi>same Place.</hi> And I have contented my self here with <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Gesture</hi> fitted only to the <hi>present Practice</hi> and <hi>Humour</hi> of the Age we live in; where I may have omitted many things perhaps, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have more copiously remark'd; but I think I have taken notice of the most <hi>principal, useful</hi> and <hi>necessary ACTIONS.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THere are several other things to be observed yet, either upon the different <hi>Modulations</hi> and <hi>Inflexions of the Voyce,</hi> or upon the <hi>Formation</hi> of <hi>Gestures</hi> and <hi>Motions of the Body;</hi> and those relating to the <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Eyes</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, which 'tis wonderfully diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, not to say impossible, to <hi>describe</hi> or to <hi>represent</hi> in <hi>Writing.</hi> You must learn those things by <hi>Practice</hi> in the Presence of a Friend; in <hi>hearing</hi> a <hi>good Master,</hi> and <hi>speaking</hi> often before him; so that he may set you right, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are out, either in your <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation</hi> or <hi>Gesture.</hi> And therefore St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> in one of his <hi>Letters</hi> to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:173675:123"/> give <hi>Paulinus</hi> his Friend to understand the true Sense of a Passage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by the manner of <hi>pronouncing</hi> it; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses himself for doing it in <hi>Writing,</hi> or any otherwise than <hi>Vivâ voce.</hi> Which may very well serve us also for an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology,</hi> that we do not undertake to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain things of that Nature more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>this Treatise.</hi> What I have said here, being well <hi>practic'd,</hi> will be sufficient in my opinion, to acquire a <hi>good Gesture</hi> and a <hi>laudable Pronunciation.</hi> But before I finish this little <hi>Tract,</hi> I have some <hi>general Hints</hi> to give the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> for a conclusion; which will be of no little Use and Advantage perhaps to an <hi>Orator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I am to tell you, that the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>this Art,</hi> to use <hi>Cicero</hi>'s own Words for't, <hi>are far more magnificent in Practice than in Praecept.</hi> For when we <hi>teach</hi> them only, they seem <hi>flat, low</hi> and of <hi>little importance;</hi> but being well and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly <hi>observed,</hi> they give a wonderful <hi>Lustre</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> to a Discourse. And this <hi>practice</hi> very often renders an <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Speech</hi> more <hi>handsome, persuasive</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:173675:123"/> and <hi>charming,</hi> than another that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly <hi>fuller</hi> of Perfection in <hi>it self,</hi> but wants all the external <hi>advantages</hi> of <hi>Action.</hi> You must not therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise <hi>these Praecepts,</hi> although some of them seem to be <hi>light</hi> and <hi>childish,</hi> or scarce worth a <hi>sober consideration.</hi> But I must add this, that when I say the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi> ought to <hi>observe</hi> them, I do not mean, that either the <hi>Lawyer</hi> should be poring upon it, when he <hi>Pleads his Cause;</hi> or the <hi>Divine,</hi> when he <hi>Preaches his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> For he ought to think of nothing at that time but the matter in hand; and he must not be studying any other <hi>Motions</hi> or <hi>Passions</hi> then, but use <hi>those only</hi> which arise naturally from the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of his <hi>Discourse,</hi> from the <hi>Place</hi> where he speaks and the <hi>Presence</hi> of the <hi>Person,</hi> to whom he addresses himself: For the very thought of <hi>Rules</hi> and the <hi>care</hi> of <hi>observing</hi> them would mightily distract and amuse him upon <hi>that Conjuncture.</hi> Besides that it would take off the Warmth and Spirit of his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> perplex his <hi>Head,</hi> and disturb his <hi>Memory.</hi> For as St. <hi>Austin</hi> says in his Books of <hi>Christian Doctrine. 'Tis not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:173675:124"/> possible for a Man to speak</hi> well, <hi>and at the same time to be thinking of the</hi> Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts <hi>that are laid down upon the</hi> Art of Speaking well; <hi>and he must have great care whoever takes so much pains to</hi> speak <hi>according to</hi> Rules, <hi>lest the</hi> things <hi>which he must</hi> necessarily speak of, <hi>slip out of his</hi> Memory.</p>
               <p>I do not <hi>mean</hi> neither, that as often as you have occasion to <hi>speak in Publick,</hi> you ought to study all the <hi>Actions</hi> which you must make use of, <hi>beforehand,</hi> in your <hi>Closet;</hi> whether they be for the <hi>Pulpit</hi> or the <hi>Barr;</hi> as <hi>Roscius</hi> us'd to do, who the <hi>Antients</hi> say, never exercised any <hi>Gesture</hi> before <hi>People</hi> but what he had study'd in <hi>Private.</hi> For that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible both for a <hi>Divine</hi> that has a number of <hi>Sermons</hi> to make, and for a <hi>Lawyer</hi> that has a great many <hi>Causes</hi> to plead: And yet if they had <hi>time</hi> for't; it would be but ill spent upon the Study of so <hi>trivial</hi> a Business as <hi>Action</hi> is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; instead of giving themselves up entirely to meditate upon the <hi>grave things</hi> they have to say and the <hi>important Affairs</hi> they have to manage. Their <hi>time</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:173675:124"/> would be mightily misemployed upon <hi>Niceties;</hi> and the very Persons they should speak to, would neither desire it, nor expect it from them. For, as <hi>Antony</hi> has very well observed, in <hi>Cicero,</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi> do not require the same exactness and care from an <hi>Orator,</hi> in this point, which they do from an <hi>Actor;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when they hear an <hi>Actor</hi> in the <hi>Theatre,</hi> they do not so much mind the things that are represented there, which they know to be <hi>False</hi> and <hi>Fabulous;</hi> but are wholly taken up with the fine way of <hi>Acting;</hi> that is to say, either with the <hi>Elegancy</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution,</hi> or with the <hi>Grace</hi> of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation</hi> and <hi>Gesture:</hi> And if he do not please their <hi>Senses,</hi> they are disgust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him. But when they hear an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,</hi> they attend chiefly to <hi>serious things,</hi> and to the <hi>important points</hi> of his <hi>Discourse;</hi> and as for his <hi>Action</hi> they are well enough satisfied, if it be but <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>agreeable,</hi> and do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend either their <hi>Ears</hi> or their <hi>Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In short, all I would have a Man do that proposes to accomplish <hi>this Art</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:173675:125"/> of <hi>Speaking</hi> well in <hi>Publick,</hi> is only to understand these <hi>Praecepts</hi> of <hi>Action</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ventures upon't; to try them upon his own <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>son</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> them in <hi>Private,</hi> and to endeavour to get a good <hi>Habit</hi> and the <hi>Knack</hi> of Speaking by <hi>care</hi> and <hi>continual Exercice.</hi> For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to acquire as <hi>long a Breath</hi> as possible, he must practice upon <hi>this Period</hi> of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s in his <hi>Oration</hi> for the <hi>Manilian Law.</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">What a shame 'tis, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that he who Murder'd so many of our <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi> in one Day, over all <hi>Asia,</hi> in so many several Places there, with a Word of his Mouth, and by one single Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch; has not yet suffer'd Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for so foul a Crime, but reign'd these three and twenty years since that horrid Massacre; and reign'd with so much Impudence too, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver absconds for it, either in the Kingdom of <hi>Pontus,</hi> or in the Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> but braves it in the Estate of his Ancestors, and huffs you in your own Revenues, in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Light of all <hi>Asia.</hi>
                  </q> Now it would be strangely difficult for a Man at first, to pronounce <hi>this whole Sentence</hi> all at a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:173675:125"/>
                  <hi>Breath,</hi> and I think indeed absolutely impossible too. But he may learn to <hi>speak</hi> it easily however, <hi>at three Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> the first ending at, <hi>one single Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch;</hi> the second at, <hi>three and twenty years since that Massacre;</hi> and the third at, <hi>the greatest Light of all</hi> Asia. And when he can do't thus with facility, let him try again to pronounce it at <hi>two Breathings</hi> only; the one ending at <hi>since that Massacre,</hi> and the other at the end of the <hi>Period.</hi> If he cannot do't yet with Ease, let him take his <hi>Breath</hi> sometimes softly, without any Bodies perceiving it, to carry him <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the whole Sentence,</hi> and especially to <hi>keep-up his Voyce</hi> to the last. But if that be too hard for him also, to take <hi>Breath</hi> enough without discovery to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the <hi>length</hi> of the Expression, let him <hi>Conn</hi> this Period of the same <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by Heart. <hi>Pleasure does not tempt him out of his way, to seek after sensual Delights; nor Avarice to make any rich Booty; nor the Beauty of a Place to divert himself there; nor the Fame of a City to take notice on't; nor the labour and lassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a long Journy, to refresh himself
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:173675:126"/> with agreeable satisfactions upon the</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue. And then let him endeavour to repeat it all at a <hi>Breath,</hi> over and over, till he has gained his point; for <hi>this Exercice,</hi> as far as I can judge of it by the <hi>extent</hi> of my own <hi>Breath,</hi> will render it easy to him and make him <hi>long-winded</hi> without any great danger or difficulty.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Practice</hi> will teach us the <hi>variation of the Voyce</hi> too, as well as all other <hi>Things,</hi> which we have said ought to be observed towards the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an <hi>agreeable Pronunciation:</hi> And to this purpose, I would have the <hi>young Gentleman</hi> first <hi>read</hi> and get without <hi>Book</hi> some <hi>fine Passages</hi> or other of the most excellent <hi>Orators,</hi> whether <hi>Antient</hi> or <hi>Modern;</hi> and after that, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating a <hi>Sentence</hi> sometimes over and over to himself, till he knows how to <hi>pronounce</hi> it according to <hi>Art.</hi> He must be exercicing himself upon it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and frequently shew it also in his common <hi>Conversation;</hi> for he'll never learn to <hi>speak well</hi> without <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> as well as <hi>Theory.</hi> I said express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:173675:126"/>
                  <hi>some fine Passages or other;</hi> because <hi>they</hi> will be less troublesome to get by Heart and to Repeat. The <hi>Repetition</hi> otherwise would be <hi>tedious</hi> without <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy.</hi> This will have another good effect too: Those <hi>illustrious Passages,</hi> with which he may stock his Memory, will serve him for so many excellent <hi>Models,</hi> in making his own <hi>Periods</hi> and polishing his Expressions. And the more <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Beauties</hi> he finds in them, so much the <hi>higher</hi> they'll raise his <hi>Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and the more they'll improve his <hi>Fancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would advise him also to observe <hi>these Rules</hi> of <hi>Pronunciation</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> in his <hi>ordinary Discourses;</hi> as far at least as the things he speaks of will permit, until he has got an absolute <hi>Habit</hi> on't, and it may be said that his <hi>Action</hi> is become <hi>Natural.</hi> But if he cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that of <hi>himself,</hi> without help; he must take a <hi>Master,</hi> who both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands and teaches <hi>this Art</hi> well; exercice and accomplish himself under his <hi>Discipline;</hi> and take delight too in his <hi>Corrections,</hi> with <hi>submission,</hi> as often
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:173675:127"/> as he finds himself commit an Error against the <hi>Rules of Action,</hi> whether it be in <hi>Pronunciation</hi> or in <hi>Gesture.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that he ought to be careful and curious whenever he has an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of hearing either any <hi>famous Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi> or any great <hi>Preachers,</hi> to observe with the utmost attention what confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity their <hi>Action</hi> keeps to these <hi>Rules,</hi> and what makes them merit the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of their <hi>Auditors,</hi> upon their <hi>Harangues.</hi> He ought to put himself afterwards upon <hi>imitating</hi> them at <hi>home,</hi> and to make their <hi>Graces</hi> his own at last in <hi>Publick.</hi> For as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> says, <hi>Eloquence imprints it self far more easily upon the Minds of those that</hi> hear <hi>eloquent Men, than the Minds of those that only follow</hi> Praecepts <hi>and read</hi> Books. And the lively Examples or Patterns of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Action</hi> are of far more benefit and advantage to young Students, than all the <hi>Doctrines of the Schools.</hi> But when he has once acquir'd a <hi>good Habit</hi> of <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> by such assistances as these, he need not put himself any more in pain for his <hi>Pronunciation</hi> and <hi>Gesture,</hi> nor will ever have occasion to make any more
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:173675:127"/> tedious Reflexions upon this <hi>Art,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Preaching</hi> or in <hi>Pleading,</hi> or in preparing himself for the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other.</hi> Only he would do well, for the first year of his <hi>Speaking in Publick,</hi> to get some of his <hi>Confidents</hi> to observe the <hi>Inflexions of his Voyce</hi> and the <hi>Motions of his Body</hi> in his <hi>Publique Performances,</hi> so that if they discover any notorious <hi>vice</hi> in his <hi>Pronunciation</hi> or palpable ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity in his <hi>Gesture,</hi> they may tell him his faults, and <hi>he</hi> may make it his <hi>Business</hi> to correct them upon their <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> But if he meet with any other <hi>Persons</hi> yet, Strangers to him, who have something to say perhaps against his <hi>Action,</hi> with good reason, he must endeavour still to improve himself for the <hi>best,</hi> hear all Peoples opinions, and neglect nothing that may render him more <hi>accomplisht</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> to his <hi>AƲDITORS.</hi>
